Wilson, Wilson
Wilson

Once upon a time there was a mountain
That rose out of a vast green forest
And in the forest there were birds
And lakes and rocks and trees and rivers

The forest was also inhabited
By a small group of people called the lizards
The lizards were a simple people
And they had lived in the forest undisturbed
For thousands of years in utter peace and tranquility

Once a year when spring came
And the first blossoms began to show
The lizards would gather at the base of the mountain
To give thanks for all that they had

They thanked the birds
And they thanked the lakes and they thanked the rocks
And the trees and the rivers
But most importantly, they thanked Icculus

Icculus lived at the top of the mountain
Or at least everyone thought so
For no one had actually ever seen him

But they knew he existed
Because they had the Helping Friendly Book
Icculus had given the Helping Friendly Book
To the Lizards thousands of years earlier as a gift

It contained all of the knowledge
Inherent in the universe
And had enabled the Lizards
To exist in harmony with nature for years

And so they lived
Until one day a traveler arrived in Gamehendge
His name was Wilson
And he quickly became intrigued
By the Lizards way of life

He asked if he could stay on
And live in the forest
And the Lizards, who had never seen an outsider
Were happy to oblige

Wilson lived with the Lizards for a few years
Studying the ways of the Helping Friendly Book
And all was well

Until one morning when they awoke and the book was gone
Wilson explained that he had hidden the book
Knowing that the Lizards had become
Dependent on it for survival

He declared himself king
And enslaved the innocent people of Gamehendge
He cut down the trees and built a city
Which he called Prussia

And in the center of the city
He built a castle
And locked in the highest tower of the castle",The_Beatles,rise inhabit call live come begin show would gather give thank thank thank thank live think see know exist help give help contain enable exist live arrive become ask could stay live see oblige live study help awake go explain hide know become declare enslave cut build call build lock,time mountain forest forest bird lake rock tree river forest group people lizard lizard people forest thousand year peace tranquility year spring blossom lizard base mountain thank bird lake rock tree river top mountain one thousand year gift knowledge universe harmony nature year day traveler name way life forest outsider year way morning book book survival king people tree city center city castle tower castle,once also once when most importantly so actually ever early so quickly never when,Wilson Wilson Wilson Wilson Wilson time mountain rise vast green forest forest bird lake rock tree river forest inhabit small group people call lizard lizard simple people live forest undisturbed thousand year utter peace tranquility year spring come blossom begin lizard gather base mountain thank thank bird thank lake thank rock tree river importantly thank Icculus Icculus live mountain think actually see know exist help Friendly Book Icculus give help Friendly Book Lizards thousand year early gift contain knowledge inherent universe enable Lizards exist harmony nature year live day traveler arrive Gamehendge Wilson quickly intrigued Lizards way life ask stay live forest Lizards see outsider happy oblige Wilson live Lizards year study way help Friendly Book morning awake book go Wilson explain hide book know Lizards dependent survival declare king enslave innocent people Gamehendge cut tree build city call Prussia center city build castle lock high tower castle

Of every head he's had the pleasure to know
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say, ""Hello""

On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
And little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mac
In the pouring rain, very strange

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back
In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It's a clean machine

Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
A four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back
Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway

In Penny Lane, the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain, very strange

Giving all your clothes to charity.

Eating chocolate cake in a bag.

They look just like two Gurus in a drag.

When I look into your eyes, your love is there for me
And the more I go inside, the more there is to see

It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere, it's what you make
For us to take, it's all too much

Makes no difference where you are or where you'd like to be

It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around here
All the world's a birthday cake
So take a piece but not too much

Set me on a silver sun, for I know that I'm free
Show me that I'm everywhere, and get me home for tea

It's all to much for me to see
A love that's shining all around here
The more I am, the less I know
And what I do is all too much

And he began to cry.

I got no daddy's smile.

Or sue me when I cry, 
'Cause sometimes I feel so lonesome 
I wish that I could die.

Where all blinds can see.

It will be a home for me.

To critize the Beatles' hair.

Standing there

As the day begins
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more

She goes downstairs to the kitchen
Clutching her handkerchief
Quietly turning the backdoor key
Stepping outside, she is free

She(we gave her most of our lives)
Is leaving (sacrificed most of our lives)
Home (we gave her everything money could buy)
She's leaving home, after living alone, for so many years (bye bye)

Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter that's lying there
Standing alone at the top of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband
""Daddy, our baby's gone.
""Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly?
How could she do this to me?""

She (we never thought of ourselves)
Is leaving (never a thought for ourselves)
Home (we struggled hard all our lives to get by)
She's leaving home, after living alone, for so many years

Friday morning, at nine o'clock
She is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the Motortrade

She (what did we do that was wrong)
Is Having (we didn't know it was wrong)

There is no one compares with you

There stand a country cabin
Made of clay and wood
Where lives a young country boy
Named Johnny B. Goode

To read or write a book so well
But he could play his guitar
Just like a-ringing a bell

Go go, go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!

In a gunny sack
Sit beneath the trees
By the railroad track
Oh sitting and a-playing
In the shade
Drumming to the rhythm
That the drivers made
People passing by
Used to stop and say
My oh my
That country boy can play

Go go, go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Aah Johnny B. Goode!

Well his mama told him
Someday you will be a man
And you will be the leader
Of a big old band
Many people coming
From miles around
To hear you play your music
Till the sun goes down
Maybe some day

In case of accidents he always took his mom
He's the all American bullet-headed saxon mother's son.

Deep in the jungle where the mighty tiger lies
Bill and his elephants were taken by surprise
So Captain Marvel zapped in right between the eyes

There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye
Rocky didn't like that
He said, ""I'm gonna get that boy""
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon

Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideon's Bible
Rocky had come, equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival
His rival it seems, had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy
Her name was Magill, and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy
Now she and her man, who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoe down
Rocky burst in, and grinning a grin
He said, ""Danny boy, this is a showdown""
But Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner

Now the doctor came in, stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said, ""Rocky, you met your match""
And Rocky said, ""Doc, it's only a scratch
And I'll be better, I'll be better, Doc, as soon as I am able""

Now Rocky Raccoon, he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideon's Bible

Calls her on the phone
""Can I take you out to the pictures
Joa, oa, oa, oan?""

But as she's getting ready to go
A knock comes on the door

Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant
Sce, e, e, ene

She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away
So he waits behind
Writing fifty times ""I must not be
So, o, o, o""

But when she turns her back on the boy
He creeps up from behind

Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

P. C. Thirty-one said, ""We caught a dirty one""
Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Rose and Valerie, screaming from the gallery
Say he must go free
(Maxwell must go free)
The judge does not agree and he tells them
So, o, o, o

But as the words are leaving his lips
A noise comes from behind

Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon his head
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that he was dead

With tangerine trees and marmalade skies.
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly,
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes.

Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head.
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone.

Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds, ah, ah

Follow her down to a bridge by the fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies.
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high.

Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds 
And you're gone.

With plasticine porters with looking glass ties,
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile,

And everybody spoke and I went into a dream

With hurry homedrops on her cheek

And soon Miss Fanny Bright, was seated by my side 
The horse was lean and lank, misfortune seemed his lot 
He got into a drifted bank and we got upsot

I went out on the snow, and on my back I fell
A gent was riding by, in a one-horse open sleigh 
He laughed as there I sprawling lie but quickly drove away

You never give me your money
You only give me your funny paper
And in the middle of negotiations
You break down

I never give you my number
I only give you my situation
And in the middle of investigation
I break down

Out of college, money spent
See no future, pay no rent
All the money's gone, nowhere to go
Any job, I got the sack
Monday morning, turning back
Yellow lorry slow, nowhere to go

But oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Nowhere to go

One sweet dream
Pick up the bags and get in the limousine
Soon we'll be away from here
Step on the gas and wipe that tear away
One sweet dream came true today
Came true today
Came true today
Yes, it did

Mean Mister Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark trying to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a ten-bob note up his nose

Such a mean old man
Such a mean old man

His sister Pam works in a shop
She never stops, she's a go-getter
Takes him out to look at the Queen
Only place that he's ever been
Always shouts out something obscene

But she doesn't have a lot to say

She's so good-looking but she looks like a man
Well, you should see her in drag dressed in her polythene bag
Yes, you should see Polythene Pam
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
She's killer-diller when she's dressed to the hilt
She's the kind of a girl that makes ""The News of the World""
Yes, you could say she was attractively built
Yeah, yeah, yeah

(Yeah!) Great!

Fab!

Isn't that great?
It's real good, that
Real good
Listen to that, Mal
Oh look out! It's-

She came in through the bathroom window
Protected by a silver spoon
But now she sucks her thumb and wanders
By the banks of her own lagoon

Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me

She said she'd always been a dancer
She worked at fifteen clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well, I knew what I could not say
And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal, but she could not rob

Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me, oh yeah

Once there was a way to get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home

And I will sing a lullaby

Golden slumbers fill your eyes
Smiles await you when you rise

And I will sing a lullaby

Once there was a way to get back home

I was caught in a cauldron of hate
I felt persecuted and paralyzed
I thought that everything else would just wait

While you are wasting your time on your enemies
Engulfed in a fever of spite
Beyond your tunnel vision reality fades
Like shadows into the night

To martyr yourself to caution
Is not going to help at all
'Cause there'll be no safety in numbers
When the right one walks out of the door

Can you see your days blighted by darkness?
Is it true you beat your fists on the floor?
Stuck in a world of isolation
While the ivy grows over the door

So I open my door to my enemies
And I ask could we wipe the slate clean?
But they tell me to please go f*ck myself

This is Henry McClean

And I'm ringing to say
That I'm leaving and maybe

How little we change
Isn't it sad we're insane
Playing the games that we know end in tears
The games we've been playing for thousands and thousands and thousands 

Jumps into his cosmic flyer
Pulled his plastic collar higher
Light the fuse and stand right back

He cried
This is my last goodbye

Point me at the sky and let it fly (point me at the sky and let it fly)
Point me at the sky and let it fly (point me at the sky and let it fly)
Point me at the sky and let it fly

And if you survive till two thousand and five
I hope you're exceedingly thin
For if you are stout you will have to breathe out
So the man next to you can breathe in (breathe in, breathe in, breathe in)

People pressing on my sides
Is something that I hate
And so is sitting down to eat
With only little capsules on my plate

Is your conscience at rest 
If once put to the test?

To just the beating of your heart.
Just one man beneath the sky,
Just two ears, just two eyes.

You set sail across the sea 
Of long past thoughts and memories.
Childhood's end, your fantasies 
Merge with harsh realities.
And then as the sail is hoist,
You find your eyes are growing moist.
All the fears never voiced 
Say you have to make your final choice.

Who are you and who am I 
To say we know the reason why?
Some are born; some men die 
Beneath one infinite sky.
There'll be war, there'll be peace.
But everything one day will cease.

All the proud men turned to dust.

And death is a long cold rest.

Eighty years, with luck, or even less.

And maybe you'll make it to the top.
And mind how you go, and I can tell you, 'cause I know
You may find it hard to get off.

You are the angel of death
And I am the dead man's son.
And he was buried like a mole in a fox hole.
And everyone is still in the run.

And who is the master of fox hounds?
And who says the hunt has begun?
And who calls the tune in the courtroom?
And who beats the funeral drum?

Sitting in a club with so many fools
Playing to rules
Trying to impress but feeling rather empty
I had another drink
A drink, a drink, a drink, a drink

What a way to spend that evening
They all turn up with their friends
Playing the game
But in the scene I should have been
Far away
Away, away, away, away, away, away
Getting up, I feel as if I'm remembering this scene before
I open the door to an empty room
Then I forget

The telephone rings and someone speaks
She would very much like to go out to a show
So what can I do, I can't think what to say
She sees through anyway
Away, away, away, away, away, away

Out of the front door I go
Traffic's moving rather slow
Arriving late, there she waits
Looking very angry, as cross as she can be
Be, a-be, a-be, a-be, a-be, a-be

Was chewing little bits of string
At last he swallowed some which tied
Itself in ugly knots inside

Yes they did

And finding she was left alone
Went tiptoe to the telephone, 999
And summoned the immediate aid

You fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way. 
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town 
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way. 

Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain. 
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today. 
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you. 
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun. 

So you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking 
Racing around to come up behind you again. 
The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older, 
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death. 

Every year is getting shorter never seem to find the time.

Plumes of smoke rise and merge into the leaden sky
A man lies and dreams of green fields and rivers
But awakes to a morning with no reason for waking

He's haunted by the memory of a lost paradise
In his youth or a dream, he can't be precise
He's chained forever to a world that's departed
It's not enough, it's not enough

His blood has frozen and curdled with fright
His knees have trembled and given way in the night
His hand has weakened at the moment of truth
His step has faltered

One world, one soul
Time pass, the river roll

And he talks to the river of lost love and dedication
And silent replies that swirl invitation
Flow dark and troubled to an oily sea

Running before times took our dreams away
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground
To a life consumed by slow decay

The grass was greener
The light was brighter
When friends surrounded
The nights of wonder

Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us
To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side
Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again
Dragged by the force of some in a tide
At a higher altitude with flag unfurled
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world

Encumbered forever by desire and ambition
There's a hunger still unsatisfied
Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon
Though down this road we've been so many times

As darkness falls
The waves roll by

Now sleeps the swan

And deep beneath the ground

Slide a rind down behind
The sofa in San Tropez
Breakin' a stick
With a brick on the sand
Ridin' a wave
In the wake of an old sedan

Sleepin' alone in the

Scratched by the sand that
Fell from my love,
Deep in my dreams and I
Still hear her callin'

Gone with the wind
And the rain, on an airplane
Owning a home
With no silver spoon
I'm drinking champagne
Like a good tycoon

Sooner than wait for
A break in the weather,
I'll gather my far-flung
Thoughts together
Speeding away
On the wind to a new day
And if you're alone
I'll come home

And I pause for a while
By a country style
And listen to the things they say
Diggin' for gold
With a hoe in my hand
Open a book

To the place by the sea

Hangs motionless upon the air
And deep beneath the rolling waves
In labyrinths of coral caves
The echo of a distant time
Comes willowing across the sand
And everything is green and submarine

And no one showed us to the land
And no one knows the where's or why's
But something stirs and something tries
And starts to climb toward the light

Strangers passing in the street
By chance, two separate glances meet
And I am you and what I see is me
And do I take you by the hand
And lead you through the land
And help me understand the best I can?

And no one calls us to move on
And no one forces down our eyes
No one speaks and no one tries
No one flies around the sun

Cloudless everyday
You fall upon my waking eyes
Inviting and inciting me to rise
And through the window in the wall
Come streaming in on sunlight wings
A million bright ambassadors of morning

And no one sings me lullabies
And no one makes me close my eyes

/lyric/30604329/Pink+Floyd/Dogs,Dogs,"You gotta be crazy, you gotta have a real need
You gotta sleep on your toes, and when you're on the street
You gotta be able to pick out the easy meat with your eyes closed
And then moving in silently, down wind and out of sight
You gotta strike when the moment is right without thinking

And after a while, you can work on points for style
Like the club tie, and the firm handshake
A certain look in the eye and an easy smile
You have to be trusted by the people that you lie to
So that when they turn their backs on you,
You'll get the chance to put the knife in

You gotta keep one eye looking over your shoulder
You know it's going to get harder, and harder, and harder as you get older
And in the end you'll pack up and fly down south
Hide your head in the sand,
Just another sad old man
All alone and dying of cancer

And when you loose control, you'll reap the harvest you have sown
And as the fear grows, the bad blood slows and turns to stone
And it's too late to lose the weight you used to need to throw around
So have a good drown, as you go down, all alone
Dragged down by the stone (stone, stone, stone, stone, stone)

I gotta admit that I'm a little bit confused
Sometimes it seems to me as if I'm just being used
Gotta stay awake, gotta try and shake off this creeping malaise
If I don't stand my own ground, how can I find my way out of this maze?

Deaf, dumb, and blind, you just keep on pretending
That everyone's expendable and no-one has a real friend
And it seems to you the thing to do would be to isolate the winner
And everything's done under the sun
And you believe at heart, everyone's a killer

Who was born in a house full of pain
Who was trained not to spit in the fan
Who was told what to do by the man
Who was broken by trained personnel

Who was given a pat on the back

Who was only a stranger at home

With bright knives he releaseth my soul

In the form of a scroll
With gold leaf adorned

In a drawer of old photographs, hidden away

Somewhere, old heroes shuffle safely down the street
Where you can speak out loud about your doubts and fears
And what's more, no one ever disappears
You never hear their standard issue kicking in your door
You can relax on both sides of the tracks
And maniacs don't blow holes in bandsmen by remote control
And everyone has recourse to the law
And no one kills the children anymore
No one kills the children anymore

Dial the combination, open the priest hole 
And if I'm in I'll tell you (what's behind the wall)

There's a kid who had a big hallucination 
Making love to girls in magazines 
He wonders if you're sleeping with your new found faith 
Could anybody love him 
Or is it just a crazy dream? 

And if I show you my dark side 
Will you still hold me tonight? 
And if I open my heart to you 
And show you my weak side 
What would you do? 
Would you sell your story to Rolling Stone? 
Would you take the children away 
And leave me alone? 
And smile in reassurance 
As you whisper down the phone? 
Would you send me packing? 
Or would you take me home?

Sinking behind bridges in the road 
And I think of all the good things 
That we have left undone 
And I suffer premonitions 
Confirm suspicions 
Of the holocaust to come. 

The wire that holds the cork 
That keeps the anger in 
Gives way 
And suddenly it's day again. 
The sun is in the east 
Even though the day is done. 
Two suns in the sunset 
Hmm
Could be the human race is run. 

Like the moment when the brakes lock 
And you slide towards the big truck 
""Oh no!"" 
""Daddy, Daddy!"" 
You stretch the frozen moments with your fear. 
And you'll never hear their voices 
And you'll never see their faces 
You have no recourse to the law anymore. 

And as the windshield melts 
My tears evaporate 
Leaving only charcoal to defend. 
Finally I understand the feelings of the few. 
Ashes and diamonds 
Foe and friend 
We were all equal in the end.

Hollow laughter in marble halls

Has unleashed the dogs of war

Signed, sealed, they deliver oblivion
We all have a dark side, to say the least
And dealing in death is the nature of the beast

But wherever you go, you know they've been there before

A glazed look and I was on the road to ruin
The music played and played as we whirled without end
No hint, no word her honour to defend

I will, I will she sighed to my request
And then she tossed her mane while my resolve was put to the test
Then drowned in desire, our souls on fire
I lead the way to the funeral pyre
And without a thought of the consequence
I gave in to my decadence

One slip, and down the hole we fall
It seems to take no time at all
A momentary lapse of reason
That binds a life for life
A small regret, you won't forget,
There'll be no sleep in here tonight

Was it love, or was it the idea of being in love?
Or was it the hand of fate, that seemed to fit just like a glove?
The moment slipped by and soon the seeds were sown
The year grew late and neither one wanted to remain alone

And the words they say
Which we won't understand

""Don't accept that what's happening
Is just a case of others' suffering
Or you'll find that you're joining in
The turning away""

It's a sin that somehow
Light is changing to shadow
And casting it's shroud
Over all we have known

Unaware how the ranks have grown
Driven on by a heart of stone
We could find that we're all alone
In the dream of the proud

On the wings of the night
As the daytime is stirring
Where the speechless unite
In a silent accord

Using words you will find are strange
And mesmerized as they light the flame
Feel the new wind of change
On the wings of the night

No more turning away
From the weak and the weary
No more turning away
From the coldness inside

Just a world that we all must share

One kiss, one single kiss
A face outside the window pane
However did it come to this?

A man who ran, a child who cried
A girl who heard, a voice that lied
The sun that burned a fiery red
The vision of an empty bed

The use of force, he was so tough
She'll soon submit, she's had enough
The march of fate, the broken will
Someone is lying very still

He has laughed and he has cried
He has fought and he has died
He's just the same as all the rest
He's not the worst, he's not the best

And still this ceaseless murmuring
The babbling that I brook
The seas of faces, eyes upraised
The empty screen, the vacant look

A man in black on a snow white horse,
A pointless life has run its course,
The red rimmed eyes, the tears still run
As he fades into the setting sun

You're going on that plane to take you where you belong.
But no, I have
You have got to listen to me. 
Do you have any idea what you have to look forward to if you stay here? 
Nine chances out of ten we both end up in a concentration camp and that
You're only saying these things to make me go.
I'm saying it 'cause it's true. Inside us, we both know we belong in different
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life.

Promises lit up the night like paper doves in flight

I dreamed you had left my side
No warmth not even pride remained
And even though you needed me
It was clear that I could not do a thing for you

Now life devalues day by day
As friends and neighbours turn away
And there's a change that, even with regret
Cannot be undone

While nations wash their bloodied hands
Of loyalty, of history, in shades of gray

But he's coming around

Clear through the clouds that covered me
Just give it time then speak my name

/lyric/30604227/Pink+Floyd/Time+%5BEdit%5D+%5BEdit%5D,Time [Edit] [Edit],"Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
You fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way

Tired of lying in the sunshine, staying home to watch the rain
You are young and life is long, and there is time to kill today
And then one day you find ten years have got behind you
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun

So you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking
Racing around to come up behind you again
The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death

Every year is getting shorter never seem to find the time
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time is gone, the song is over
Thought I'd something more to say

Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
When I come home cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
Far away across the field

Stretched to the point of no turning back
A flight of fancy on a windswept field
Standing alone my senses reeled
A fatal attraction is holding me fast how
How can I escape this irresistible grasp? 

Can't keep my eyes from the circling skies
Tongue tied and twisted just an earth bound misfit, I

Ice is forming on the tips of my wings
Unheeded warnings I thought I thought of everything
No navigator to find my way home
Unladened, empty and turned to stone

A soul in tension that's learning to fly
Condition grounded but determined to try
Can't keep my eyes from the circling skies
Tongue-tied and twisted just an earth-bound misfit, I

Friction lock, set
Mixtures, rich
Propellers, fully forward
Flaps, set, ten degrees
Engine gauges and suction, check

Mixture set to maximum percent, recheck
Flight instruments
Altimeters, check both
(Garbled word) on
Navigation lights, on
Strobes, on
Confirm three-eight-echo ready for departure
Hello again, this is now 129.4
129.4, it's to go 
You may commence your takeoff, winds over ten knots
Three-eight-echo
Easy on the brakes, take it easy, its gonna roll this time
Just hand the power gradually, and it

Above the planet on a wing and a prayer,
My grubby halo, a vapor trail in the empty air,
Across the clouds I see my shadow fly
Out of the corner of my watering eye
A dream unthreatened by the morning light
Could blow this soul right through the roof of the night

In the shadow under the trees
Down by a stream in a hollow
Turn your head feel the breeze

And the red Queen was waiting for the news
For the white King to move
And the balance hung upon the head of one who tried
To stay within the shadows
And keep his undercover secret tight

They let him in by a back way
Into a chamber reserved for the Queen
She took the note that he gave her
Opened it slowly and started to read

Run to the treasury and bring me back some gold
Give it to the pawn who came, she cried
He says the white King thinks the game of chess is wrong
And all the courtiers crowded her
And this is what she told the gathered round

Go to the store by the dungeon
Take all the red paint take all the white
Make up a newborn color

In a world of magnets and miracles
Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary
The ringing of the division bell had begun

Along the Long Road and on down the Causeway
Do they still meet there by the Cut

There was a ragged band that followed in our footsteps
Running before times took our dreams away
Leaving the myriad small creatures trying to tie us to the ground
To a life consumed by slow decay

The grass was greener
The light was brighter
When friends surrounded
The nights of wonder

Looking beyond the embers of bridges glowing behind us
To a glimpse of how green it was on the other side
Steps taken forwards but sleepwalking back again
Dragged by the force of some inner tide
At a higher altitude with flag unfurled
We reached the dizzy heights of that dreamed of world

Encumbered forever by desire and ambition
There's a hunger still unsatisfied
Our weary eyes still stray to the horizon
Though down this road we've been so many times

The grass was greener
The light was brighter
The taste was sweeter
The nights of wonder
With friends surrounded
The dawn mist glowing
The water flowing
The endless river

I was thinking all about her, burning with rage and desire
We were spinning into darkness the earth was on fire

She could take it back, she might take it back some day

So I spy on her, I lie to her, I make promises I cannot keep
Then I hear her laughter rising, rising from the deep
And I make her prove her love for me, I take all that I can take
I push her to the limit to see if she will break

She might take it back, she could take it back some day

Now I have seen the warnings, screaming from all sides
It’s easy to ignore them, God knows I’ve tried
All of this temptation, you know it turned my faith to lies
Until I couldn’t see the danger or hear the rising tide

Wining, dining, shining king
Now the eagle flies in clear blue skies

But fifty more come rolling off the floor production line
Then a man commuting like a village on the sand
In his hand a moving picture of the crumbling land

Close your eyes, count till ten and see the sunrise rise

Guess that they don't really make 'em like me no more

'Cause if y'all what I created then I hate myself
But still, let them girls in
And tell them all leave their cell phones
On the table where we see them
I'm all day with it man, A.M to the P.M
Niggas hating, I just wish that they would say it when they see him

That's that ish that drives me crazy

Life of the party, pourin' shots of the brown
And you see me from the street but I don't turn around
Would you say, ""Hi""? Would you keep going?

If I told your family that you didn't mean nothing
If you posted about it and I didn't even comment
If the songs weren't true, but you still feel something
Would you still come looking for me?

Oh, don't go reaching out
'Cause you can't have everything
Your head and your heart won't feel the same
Even if it feels like it every time

Don't check on me
If we're not together, then it's probably for a reason
Every heartbreak has its season
It ain't always summer in June

Might run across your mind but don't worry 'bout me, no
My heart is back in one piece, it ain't skipped a beat, no
Feeling rested up, I ain't missing sleep, no oh
Don't take it personal if I can't reply now
I'm distant 'cause I don't wanna be reached now
Won't let the ghosts of our past weigh my future down
I'm liberated
Energy's like a circle, it comes back around
Reciprocated
Don't shed no more tears
Won't gain no empathy from me
In the upcoming years
Oh, I don't need your pity
Don't check on me

Oh, don't check on me
If we're not together, then it's probably for a reason
Every heartbreak has its season
And it looks like winter for you

Ain't call you back 'cause I let it go
I had to focus energy and just let it flow
And when we ride low, we're already gone
It wouldn't mean anymore to me now
I know it hurts you so bad just to see me happy
That I finally moved on, and you thought it wouldn't happen
At times I used to cry, wouldn't know when I was laughing
But I act like I didn't notice

Oh, don't go reaching out
'Cause you can't have everything
You can't kill a flame with gasoline
Even if it feels like it every time (No matter how hard you try)

You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?

I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
And by once or twice I mean maybe a couple of hundred times
So let me, oh, let me redeem, oh, redeem, oh, myself tonight

My sunrise on the darkest day 
Got me feelin' some kind of way 
Make me wanna savor every moment slowly, slowly 
You fit me, tailor-made love, how you put it on 
Got the only key, know how to turn it on 
The way you nibble on my ear, the only words I wanna hear 
Baby take it slow so we can last long 

Oh, tú, tú eres el imán y yo soy el metal 
Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan 
Solo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso 
(Oh, yeah) Ya, ya me está gustando más de lo normal 
Todos mis sentidos van pidiendo más 
Esto hay que tomarlo sin ningún apuro

Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito 
Deja que te diga cosas al oído 
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo 
Despacito 
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito 
Firmo en las paredes de tu laberinto 
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito 
Sube, sube, sube, sube, sube

Quiero ver bailar tu pelo 
Quiero ser tu ritmo 
Que le enseñes a mi boca 
Tus lugares favoritos (Favoritos, favoritos, baby) 
Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro 
Hasta provocar tus gritos 
Y que olvides tu apellido 

Si te pido un beso, ven, dámelo 
Yo sé que estás pensándolo 
Llevo tiempo intentándolo 
Mami, esto es dando y dándolo 
Sabes que tu corazón conmigo te hace bom, bom 
Sabes que esa beba está buscando de mi bom, bom 
Ven, prueba de mi boca para ver cómo te sabe 
Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuánto amor a ti te cabe 
Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje 
Empecemos lento, después salvaje 

Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito 
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito 
Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza 
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza 
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito 
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito 
Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas 
Pero pa' montarlo aquí tengo la pieza 
¡Oye!

What else can we do when we're feeling low?
So take a deep breath and let it go
You shouldn't be drowning on your own

I will still be patient with you
And I hope you know

I won't let go

'Cause we all get lost sometimes, you know?
It's how we learn and how we grow

Even though you might get mad at me, oh, oh
Sometimes it's hard to face reality

Should've been adjusted to my life
Had the opportunity to stay and wait for the last time
Now you're standin' right in front of me
It hurts me to know that I lied
Try to protect your feelings
You read in between the lines
Hope your heart has started healing

Sometimes it's hard to face reality, oh, oh
Even though you might get mad at me, oh, oh
Sometimes it's hard to face reality

Don't be afraid to stand alone
Don't be afraid to stand outside your comfort zone

Even though you might get mad at me, oh, oh
Sometimes it's hard to face reality
Sometimes it's hard to face reality

Love and death are quite similar
How they come and go like cat burglars
Reality is kind of hard to face
Like actual facts and flat-earthers
Rain's a requirement for flowers to grow
And pain's a requirement for power to grow
It's a miracle how one could change from one what was just hours ago
Such is life though, it's just a cycle
The bigger picture and the smaller picture
Are exactly same, it's macro, micro
Crack your ad and let your light glow
One day you can be the king of pop
And the next one just be wack ol' Michael
It's human nature, just like he told us
Let's face reality, crack the cycle

Know it hurts to see the truth in your face
Circumstances bring you down to your knees
Go on and cry an ocean, but don't drown in it
Enough to put your heart at ease
Ooh, don't lose your self esteem
I apologise, for being a man
It's way harder than what it seems

Sometimes it's hard to face reality, oh, oh (reality)
Even though you might get mad at me, oh, oh (you might get mad at me, but I'll be at your bedside)

And your legs and your arms just to harness you up
Then we hit the floor

Real deep pockets like a doctors clothes
Stay fitted like Diddy hair back tryna rock the boat

I'm believing you'll pick up one day
I don't wanna add to your pain at all
I'm praying that time makes a change in your life
I'm realizing how much you made a change in my life
And I don't wanna spend it with nobody else
Hear me? don't nobody deserve myself
Oh no, baby what I'm saying is

You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Right now, don't rush, no pressure
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Calm down, don't rush, no pressure

Thought that you were in it for the paper
Never thought I'd take you serious
Now I need you, not a moment later
Losin' it, I'm so delirious
And I'ma put up a fight for it
Never give up a love like this
Finally I found someone
That can do me like no other
Talking to my conscience
I made a few mistakes
I did it to myself
I'm the only one to blame
I know you need a little while to believe again
To love again

You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Right now, don't rush, no pressure
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now

You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now

Put my key in the ignition
Don't rush it girl, just stretch it out for me
I know that you ain't got no plans to leave
Girl I need your attention
And every time I see you make that face
I wanna love you all over the place
Don't do it, baby
Don't do it to me, no

I know you don't wanna talk, right
We've been on and off like the crosslights
You heard I'm playin' with them hoes like I golf, right?
When I touch you, I get frostbite
Girl you're so cold, so cold, so cold
How we so young but livin' so old?
In the bed together but we sleepin' solo
That could drive you loco
You're supposed to be my uno, Yoko Ono
Oh no, round two again
We've been fighting more than Ryu and Ken
Last time we argued eight straight days
I learned my lesson, I got straight As
And I know it's deeper than masseuses
Oh, you know I eat the cookie like I'm Lucious
Go ahead and take the time
But it's a waste of time if your waist ain't on mine
Think about it

You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Right now, don't rush, no pressure
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now

Try to figure out which way to go
It's like you're stuck on a treadmill
Running in the same place
You got your hazard lights on now
Hoping that somebody would slow down
Praying for a miracle
Who'll show you grace?
Had a couple dollars and a quarter tank of gas
With a long journey ahead
Seen a truck pull over
God sent an angel to help you out
He gave you direction
Showed you how to read a map
With a long journey ahead
Said it ain't over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt

Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again

Relationship on a ski slope
Avalanche comin' down slow
Do we have enough time to salvage this love?
Feels like a blizzard in April
'Cause my heart is just that cold
Skating on thin ice
But it's strong enough to hold us up
Seen her scream and holler
Put us both on blast
Tearing each other down
When I thought it was over
God sent us an angel to help us out
He gave us direction, showed us how to make it last
For that long journey ahead
Said it ain't ever over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt

Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in

Is a different perception
From what the world may see

A guitar with only one string, I can only play one song, ooh
A simple melody, simple enough to make the world sing
Strong enough to make your mood swing, you know what I mean

See, growing up I
I always felt like I had to be the best at everything
'Cause I, I just didn't think I wasn't good enough
And maybe if I was good at something, that, that I'd get recognition from that but
I quickly found out that
I wasn't going to get the recognition that I wanted or that I needed because
Because, because people aren't perfect and
By not being perfect you, you sometimes can disappoint people
And with God, it's like He's perfect and He never disappoints
So I, I just get my recognition from Him

Charm yo ass in the cab on the next morning
Tell the driver gas pedal, yo Suzy I got cash to blow
Follow the leader, in high school I was an under-achiever
Made haters believers, or beliebers, look at me sir
Went from nobodies to 20k for a feature
Eat your heart out used to take the BART out
To the city from my mom house, now I ball with my tongue out
Pull out my chain and think that the sun out

Let's get going, are you foreign or complaining only moaning
Dominican, Puerto Rican, yeah, you know they do it for me
Have you seen that new Ferrari on my mind that thing is foreign
If it had some wings, we'd be flying, we'd be soarin'
Ah-ah-ah, When I'm in it I'll be thinking I don't want this thing to stop
No-o-o, But I'm thinking that you're winning if you make it to the top
Fly, That probably means you make me feel some type of way

On my way to that billay
Used to have a piggy bank, but now I got that bigger bank

Hate to bust your bubble

Keeping burning like that fire

I told her when I was younger
That I'ma be that number

About a girl and a boy
He fell in love with his best friend when she's around,
He feels nothing but joy
But she was already broken,
And it made her blind
But she could never believe that love would ever treat her right
But did you know that I loved you
Or were you not aware?
Well you're the smile on my face
And I ain't going nowhere
I'm here to make you happy,
I'm here to see you smile
But I've been wanting to tell you this for a long while

Who's gonna make you fall
In love
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless you let your
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall

Well I can tell you're afraid of
What this might do
'Cause we got such an amazing friendship and that you don't wanna lose
Well I don't wanna lose it either
But I don't think I can stay sitting around while you're hurting babe
So take my hand
Well did you know you're an angel
Who forgot how to fly?
And did you know that it breaks my heart every time to see you cry
'Cause I know that it piece of you is gone every time he done wrong
I'm the shoulder you're crying on
And I hope by the time that I'm done with this song, I figure out

What's gonna make you fall in love

But you can't fly unless you let your
You can't fly unless you let yourself fall

Make it right
This time I'll do you right
Oh, whoa, oh

Missing your good intentions
Missing you from a distance
Hope you did the same

I know that I caused a problem
Know that I left you livid
Pushed you far away

Learned it don't pay to lie

Nothing else really matters

Nothing in life is perfect
We'll be changing like the seasons

I don't wanna close my eyes
Wanna give you all I have to give

See I never thought that I could walk through fire
I never thought that I could take the burn
I never had the strength to take it higher
Until I reached the point of no return

And there's just no turning back
When your heart's under attack
Gonna give everything I have
It's my destiny

I will never say never! (I will fight)
I will fight till forever! (Make it right)

I will not stay on the ground

Ne-never say never (never)

I never thought that I could feel this free
I'm strong enough to climb the highest tower
And I'm fast enough to run across the sea

Gonna give everything I have
'Cause this is my destiny

I will never say never! (I will fight)

Jsmith and JB! (Uh-huh!)
I gotcha little bro
I can handle him
Hold up, aight?
I can handle him

Now he's bigger than me
Taller than me
And he's older than me
And stronger than me
And his arms a little bit longer than me
But he ain't on a JB song with me!

They be trying to sour the thrill

Like Luke with the force, if push comes to shove
Like Kobe in the 4th, ice water with blood

We're the flyest

So now I got the world in my hand
I was born from two stars
So the moon's where I land (I'm gone!)

Yo 'Ye whattup

Raekwon
You got stacks like the international house of pancakes
All alone ready to phone me and your hand shakes
Palms is sweat it, don't regret
Never the walk miles for love I sit at starters deck

It just happens I was floating you seen it captain?
Blinked at me then I threw on my thinking cap
Taker, and then we can slide to Jamaica
Shopping for a year or two stop in Diego

It's obvious I'm gon sue your mommy is
We just friends so she can't Clyde Bonnie us
Fly walls down in the fly halls
Come to the master suite leave every piece in the master hall
All about money tied in a know stand over there
That's why I make it happen on blocks
Brazil cut sweater, Audi, leather
Playing the field tryna outslug Berretta

You see my baby over hit the road 
Where she's going I swear nobody knows
I need to find her before another man does
I wouldn't want him to steal my love

I'm just tryin to be cool, cool, cool (tryn'a be cool)
What would you expect me to do (oh oh oh, oh oh oh, yeah)
I'm just tryin to find, find, find
That sweet love of mine

I'm runnin outta time
Where is my runway love
Searching low and high
Know that I'm not givin' up
I give it all up for her
I'll never be enough
I wont stop until I find
My runaway love

Last name West and my teeth Diamonds
She said yo what's your occupation, crazy rhyming?
Listen to Wu Tang
Trying crazy suits on 
Stuntin' in our high top Louie's
Shorts is the coogies
Open up the door when you take her to the movies

When you meet the parents you tell De Niro
Her boyfriend is zero she needs to cut the wierdo
Next show they gotta up the zeroes
Nobody rocking like this sixty years old

The hard johns and the Walleys something caught me
I'm telling you what Wu-Tang taught me
The young youth rocking the gold tooth
Pull up in a drop top old school bumping the cash rules
No question we the reason why the summers blazin'
You looking good fly color Asian
Ra I give it yo ya, no trivia
She used to roll with my G-unit like Olivia
Till she caught me getting numbers not her's
(Sweet runaway love)
Guess that's the day she became a runaway love

I'm runnin outta time
Where is my runaway love
Searching low and high
Know that I'm not givin' up
I give it all up for her
I'll never be enough
I wont stop until I find
My runaway love

Why can't I find, the love of mine, 
When you're standing in front of my face
Oh why (oh why), You must be mine
How did I let you get away

Leave it up to the most high sit in a ghost fly
Chillin' with two of my brothers we both live on deck
Grabbing em on set
This is how we roll independence she a go I'm gon go get
Take that queen assure to ya
We can live every month baby girl just call me up
Waking up mess in some cold sweats thinking of this the video tapes
Even the stress

My mind is a terrible thing to waste
No love lost I know I'm going crazy I can't floss
Me my lady left my homies
It's all baloney just like rocking an old pony
So when I chillin' I'm just lost no more feeling
I need my honey in my life get that film it
Take the time Rae Just and Ye shine
My runaway love give me mine come on

I'm runnin outta time
Where is my runaway love

At the table with the family,
Having dinner, Blackberry on the hip and then the game a little slicker,
Then it gave a lil' flicker then
I took a look to see, before it activates the ringer
Came to realize the homie Bieber hit me on the Twitter,
Then I hit him back that's right I had some food up on my fingers,
Sipping eggnog, with a little sprinkle of vanilla,
Even though it's kind of cool I'm pulling on a chinchilla,
Bieber hit me back and said lets make it hot up in the winter,
I said cool, cool,
You know I will deliver let's collaborate and make the holiday a little bigger,
Before we work I gotta get this off,
See the other family members and drop gifts off,
Then I'm headed to the studio 'cause ain't nothing stopping,
How you know we about to turn it up and really get it poppin' now,
People everywhere and all our twitter followers,

If you wanna give it's the time of year,
JB on the beat yeah yeah I'm on the stand,
It's crazy how some people say they don't care,
When there's people on the street with no food it's not fair,
It's about time for you to act merrily,
It's about time for you give to charity,
Rarely to people don't wanna even help at all,
'Cause they wont bother buying getting toys getting dolls,
Not thinking there's a family out hungry and cold,
Wishin' wishin' that they had somebody they could hold,
So I think some of you need to act bold,
Can we give to a tribe let's change the globe,

Waiting for your headlights
To pull up in the driveway
It's really coming down tonight
You're scared that I won't make it through the storm
You should be here with me, safe and warm

I'll be waiting under the mistletoe
While you're driving here through the winter snow

When the only gift that I really need
Is to have your arms wrapped around me

Trying to fight the urge to call

When we have found what life's really worth
There'll be peace on earth

Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmas time

Someday at Christmas we'll see a land
No hungry children and no empty hand
One happy morning people will share
Our world where people care

Someday at Christmas there'll be no tears
All men are equal and no men have fears
One shining moment my heart ran away
From our world today

Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free

One less lonely girl (I'm coming for you)
There's gonna be one less lonely girl (I'm coming for you)

Christmas wasn't merry, fourteenth of February, 
Not one of 'em spent with you 
How many dinner dates set dinner plates and
He didn't even touch his food
How many torn photographs are you taping back
Tell me that couldn't see an open door
But no more
If you let me inside of your world
There'll be one less lonely girl

Saw so many pretty faces

I'll show you what you're worth (that's what I'm gonna do)
If you let me inside of your world
There's gonna be on less lonely girl

I can fix up your broken heart (heart)
I can give you a brand new start (start)
I can make you believe (yeah)
I just wanna set one girl free to fall,
Free to fall (she's free to fall)
Fall in love
With me

Her hearts locked and nowhere to get the key
I'll take her and leave the world with one less lonely girl

There's gonna be one less lonely girl (one less lonely girl)

I never thought that it'd be easy
'Cause we both so distant now
And the walls are closing in on us
And we're wondering how
No one has a solid answer
We're just walking in the dark
And you can see the look on my face
It just tears me apart

So we fight through the hurt
And we cry, and cry, and cry, and cry
Then we live and we learn
And we try, and try, and try, and try

So it's up to you and it's up to me
That we meet in the middle
On our way back down to earth
Down to earth, down to earth
On our way back down to earth
Ooh, oh, oh, ooh

Mama, you were always somewhere
And Daddy I live outta town
So tell me how could I ever be normal some how
You tell me this is for the best
So tell me why am I in tears, whoa
So far away and now I just need you here

So we'll fight through the hurt
And we'll cry, and cry, and cry, and cry
Then we live and we learn
And we try, and try, and try, and try

So it's up to you and it's up to me
That we meet in the middle
On our way back down to earth
Down to earth, down to earth
On our way back down to earth
Ooh, oh, ooh, oh, ooh

We felt so far away from where we used to be
And now we're standing, and where do we go
When there's no road to get to your heart?
Let's start over again

So it's up to you and it's up to me
That we meet in the middle

Whoa oh
Remember when my heart was young
You were still bigger than me
Is that the reason that you stayed
Most would've got rid of me
Now the bully's in the school yard
Can't take our hugs and our kisses from us
Because we ain't pushovers no more baby

Girl if you see something you like then let him know
'Cause you only got one chance, for your first dance
Yeah you never forget your first dance
So take advantage of the slow dance

When I close my eyes I see me and you at the prom,
We've both been waiting so long
For this day to come
Now that it's here lets make it special
I can't deny
There's so many thoughts in my mind
The DJ's playing my favorite song ain't no chaperon's this could be
The night of our dreams

Only if you give, give the first dance to me
Girl I promise I'll be gentle, I know we gotta do it slowly
If you give, give your first dance to me
I'm gonna cherish every moment
It only happens once, once in a life time

I couldn't ask for more, we're rockin' back and forth
Under the disco ball, we're the only ones on the floor
(I can't deny), so many thoughts in my mind
The DJ's playing my favorite song, now we're all alone, here's the opportunity

Only if you give, give the first dance to me
Girl I promise I'll be gentle, I know we gotta do it slowly
If you give, give your first dance to me
I'm gonna cherish every moment,
It only happens once, once in a lifetime

Everybody says that we look cute together lets make this a night
The two us remember, no teachers around to see us dancin' close
I'm tellin' you our parents will never know
Before the lights go up and the music turns off
Now's the perfect time for me to taste your lip gloss
Your glass slippers in my hand right here, we'll
Make it before the clock strikes nine

If you just give, give the first dance to me
Girl I promise I'll be gentle but we gotta do it slowly
If you give, give the first dance to me we'll cherish every moment
It only happens once, once in a lifetime

Not one of them spent with you
How many dinner dates set dinner plates and
He didn't even touch his food
How many torn photographs are you taping back
Tell me that couldn't see an open door
But no more
If you let me inside of your world
There'll be one less lonely girl

Saw so many pretty faces
(Before I saw you you)
Now all I see is you
I'm coming for you I'm coming for you
No no
Don't need these other pretty faces like I need you
And when your mine in this world

There's gonna be one less lonely girl (I'm coming for you)
One less lonely girl (I'm coming for you)
One less lonely girl (I'm coming for you)
One less lonely girl
There's gonna be one less lonely girl (I'm coming for you)
I'm gonna put you first (I'm coming for you)
I'll show you what you're worth (that's what I'm gonna do)
If you let me inside of your world
There's gonna be on less lonely girl

I can fix up your broken heart (heart)
I can give you a brand new start (start)
I can make you believe (yeah)
I just wanna set one girl free to fall,
Free to fall (she's free to fall)
Fall in love
With me

Her hearts locked and nowhere to get the key
I'll take her and leave the world with one less lonely girl

There's gonna be one less lonely girl (one less lonely girl)
One less lonely girl (one less lonely girl)
There's gonna be one less lonely girl (one less lonely girl)
One less lonely girl (I'm coming for you)
One less lonely girl (I'm coming for you)
One less lonely girl (I'm coming for you)
One less lonely girl
There's gonna be one less lonely girl (I'm coming for you)

I'm gonna put you first (I'm coming for you)
I'll show you what you're worth (that's what I'm gonna do)
If you let me inside your world
There's gonna be on less lonely girl (I'm coming for you)
One less lonely girl (one less lonely girl)
One less lonely girl (one less lonely girl)

I'm gonna put you first (I'm coming for you)
I'll show you what you're worth (that's what I'm gonna do)

Now we don't wanna fall but,
We're tripping in our hearts and it's reckless and clumsy,
Cause I know you can't love me here

I wish we had another time,
I wish we had another place,
But everything we have is stuck in the moment,
And there's nothing my heart can do (can do),
To fight with time and space 'cause,
I'm still stuck in the moment with you

See like Adam and Eve,
Tragedy was our destiny,
Like Sunny and Cher,
I don't care,
I got you baby

See we both,
Fightin' every inch of our fiber,
Cause ain't no way,

Baby, we both have the right to disagree,
And I ain't with it,

Reminiscin' 'bout these better days,

Been missing the way you give me ambition, babe

Counting the stars with our last name on the license plate

Been thinking about you, can't get this vision out my head
Got a grip, I'm holding onto everything you say
Ain't making this up just to get you in my bed
If you ain't left yet, you can go ahead

Thinkin' 'bout you, it ain't always about me
Don't make any sense in you being lonely
Hurry up and get here now but don't speed
I'll never get over you up under me

I'm available 
Oh, yes I am 
I'm available 
Yeah, for you I am
Don't mean to sound desperate
But you made it like this
Say I'm number one on your to do list
I'm available 
I'm available 

Got my arms wide open (arms wide open)
Got my arms wide open (arms wide open)

I get frustrated when your busy
Lately that's been more than often, baby, what is this?
It's like, do you even miss me?
Feeling less than priority, you got me convinced
Convinced I'm the only one, tripping in my head
Because in reality, you live in my bed
I'm supposed to hold on to everything you said
Yes or no question, don't leave it unread

Are you available, now?
Oh here I am (oh, here I am)
Are you available? (Just tell me, yeah)
'Cause for you I am (you know I am)
Don't mean to sound desperate
But you made it like this
Say I'm number one on your to do list

Flowers open when they feel the sunlight
Moon rise, tide change right before our eyes
Aggressive but softly, you place your lips on my lips
We're each others vice

Our feelings go deep, deeper than the touching
Deeper than the ocean, so we ain't never rushing through
Our days, or our nights, ain't no repercussions
Never get enough I'm only for your consumption

Every scale needs to, be stable
Earth keeps spinning around, we're breathing
So thankful

My love for you's habitual, yeah (habitual, yeah)
Not for a moment, but forever

I think I'm falling for you
I think I'm falling for you
If you don't call me, I'll jump off the roof
If you don't call me, I'll jump off the roof

Can you call me after school? (After school)

If you don't call me, I'll jump off the roof (hey)

Kiss my sane mind goodbye, I'm bonkers now
Crazy for your love, I do the most
Walking the street up to your mama's house
Dirt road with pink skies and rainbows

Oh, I'll climb the tallest mountain just to hold your hand
And dance around, the thought of you reverbs in my head
And that's what I said

I think I'm falling for you
I think I'm falling for you (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
If you don't call me, I'll jump off the roof
If you don't call me, I'll jump off the roof
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Ah, ah, ah, ah

Hopefully, I'll find my mind
'Cause I lost it somewhere, along the way
Ooh, and I pray that you find the time
'Cause there's only so many minutes in the day
Yeah, the thought of you fills me with bliss
Looking forward to making memories, we reminisce (hey)
And got a whole lot to risk
Don't send my heart into the abyss

I think I'm falling for you (falling for you)
I think I'm falling for you (falling for you)
If you don't call me, I'll jump off the roof (don't let me do it)
If you don't call me, I'll jump off the roof (hey, I'm 'bout to lose it)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Ah, ah, ah, ah

Your hips and your eyes give me all the summer vibes
Will you sing your lullaby to me?
We walk through the night and the sun will slowly rise
There's not a place I'd rather be
Then we run up the street
Keep on skipping to the broken beat
Kissing your lips on a trampoline
Girl, I don't know what's gotten into me

I think I'm falling for you (falling for you)
I think I'm falling for you (falling for you)

/lyric/37566324/Justin+Bieber/Holy,Holy,"I hear a lot about sinners
Don't think that I'll be a saint
But I might go down to the river, uh
'Cause the way that the sky opens up when we touch
Yeah, it's makin' me say

That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy

I don't do well with the drama
And no, I can't stand it bein' fake
No, no, no, no, no, no-no-no
I don't believe in nirvana
But the way that we love in the night gave me life
Baby, I can't explain

That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me

They say we're too young and
The pimps and the players say, ""Don't go crushin'""
Wise men say, ""Fools rush in""
But I don't know (ah-ah, ah, ah)
They say we're too young and
The pimps and the players say, ""Don't go crushin'""
Wise men say, ""Fools rush in""
But I don't know (Chance the Rapper, ah)

The first step pleases the Father
Might be the hardest to take
But when you come out of the water
I'm a believer, my heart is fleshy
Life is short with a temper like Joe Pesci
They always come and sing your praises, your name is catchy
But they don't see you how I see you, Parlay and Desi
Cross, Tween, Tween, Hesi' hit the jet speed
When they get messy, go lefty, like Lionel Messi
Let's take a trip and get the Vespas or rent a jet-ski
I know the spots that got the best weed, we goin' next week
I wanna honor, wanna honor you
Bride's groom, I'm my father's child
I know when the son takes the first steps, the Father's proud
If you make it to the water He'll part the clouds
I know He made you a snack like Oscar Proud
Suffer it to be so now gotta clean it up
Formalize the union in communion He can trust
I know I ain't leavin' you like I know He ain't leavin' us
I know we believe in God and I know God believes in us

'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me

I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standin' there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwin' pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was cryin' on the staircase
Beggin' you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh oh

'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was beggin' you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
Romeo, save me, they're tryna tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
Oh, oh

I got tired of waiting
Wonderin' if you were ever comin' around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said

Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring
And said, ""Marry me, Juliet
You'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""

Oh, oh, oh

You were in college, working part-time, waiting tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of fallin'
Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts

I say, ""Can you believe it?""
As we're lyin' on the couch
The moment, I can see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now

Do you remember, we were sittin', there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing, that's ever been mine

Flash forward, and we're takin' on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

And we got bills to pay
We got nothin' figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes
This is what I thought about

Do you remember, we were sittin' there, by the water?
You put your arm around me, for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing, that's ever been mine

Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe, for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing, that's ever been mine

Oh, oh, oh, oh

And I remember that fight, two-thirty am
'Cause everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out, crying, and you followed me out into the street

Braced myself for the goodbye,
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then, you took me by surprise
You said, ""I'll never leave you alone""

You said, ""I remember how we felt, sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine""

You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing, that's ever been mine

And ah, take me out, and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover

We would sit on the stoop, I'll sing love songs to you when we're eighty

And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me

Wondering if I'd get there quicker
If I was a man
And I'm so sick of them
Coming at me again
'Cause if I was a man
Then I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I'd be the man

They'd say I hustled
Put in the work
They wouldn't shake their heads
And question how much of this I deserve
What I was wearing, if I was rude
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves
And they would toast to me, oh, let the players play
I'd be just like Leo, in Saint-Tropez

I'm so sick of running
As fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker
If I was a man
And I'm so sick of them
Coming at me again
'Cause if I was a man
Then I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I'd be the man

What's it like to brag about raking in dollars
And getting bitches and models?
And it's all good if you're bad
And it's okay if you're mad

If I was out flashin' my dollas
I'd be a bitch, not a baller
They'd paint me out to be bad
So it's okay that I'm mad

I'm so sick of running
As fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker
If I was a man (you know that)
And I'm so sick of them
Coming at me again (coming at me again)
'Cause if I was a man (if I was man)
Then I'd be the man (then I'd be the man)

As fast as I can (as fast as I can)

I say I don't want that, but what if I do?
'Cause cruelty wins in the movies
I've got a hundred thrown-out speeches I almost said to you

Easy they come, easy they go
I jump from the train, I ride off alone
I never grew up, it's getting so old
Help me hold onto you

I've been the archer
I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me, darling?
But who could stay?

Dark side, I search for your dark side
But what if I'm alright, right, right, right here?
And I cut off my nose just to spite my face
Then I hate my reflection for years and years

I wake in the night, I pace like a ghost
The room is on fire, invisible smoke
And all of my heroes die all alone
Help me hold onto you

I've been the archer,
I've been the prey
Screaming, who could ever leave me, darling?
But who could stay?
(I see right through me, I see right through me)

'Cause they see right through me
They see right through me
They see right through
Can you see right through me?
They see right through
They see right through me
I see right through me
I see right through me

All the king's horses, all the king's men
Couldn't put me together again
'Cause all of my enemies started out friends
Help me hold onto you

A cold glass
Make me wanna know that body

I am an architect, I'm drawing up the plans
It's like I'm seventeen, nobody understands
No one understands

I'll make myself at home
And he'll want me to stay

I'm crazier for you
Then I was at sixteen
Lost in a film scene
Waving homecoming queens
Marching band playing
I'm lost in the lights

American glory
Faded before me
Now I'm feeling hopeless
Ripped up my prom dress
Running through rose thorns
I saw the scoreboard
And ran for my life

Ah, ah, ah
No cameras catch my pageant smile
I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there
To see you there
It's been a long time coming but

It's you and me
That's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, ""she's a bad, bad girl"" (okay!)
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes
It's you and me
There's nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (okay!)
We're so sad, we paint the town blue
Voted most likely to run away
With you

My team is losing
Battered and bruising
I see the high fives
Between the bad guys
Leave with my head hung
You are the only one
Who seems to care

American stories
Burning before me
I'm feeling helpless
The damsels are depressed
Boys will be boys, then
Where are the wise men?
Darling, I'm scared

Ah, ah, ah
No cameras catch my muffled cries
I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there
To see you there
And now the storm is coming, but

It's you and me

Like your friends were the night that we first met
Went home and tried to stalk you on the internet
Now I've read all of the books beside your bed

The wine is cold
Like the shoulder that I gave you in the street
Cat and mouse for a month or two or three
Now I wake up in the night and watch you breathe

(Hey!) Kiss me once 'cause you know I had a long night
(Oh!) Kiss me twice 'cause it's gonna be alright
Three times 'cause I've waited my whole life
(One, two, one two three four!)

I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want, and
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want, and
Paper rings and picture frames and dirty dreams
Oh, you're the one I want

In the winter, in the icy outdoor pool
When you jumped in first, I went in too
I'm with you even if it makes me blue
Which takes me back
To the color that we painted your brother's wall
Honey, without all the exes, fights, and flaws
We wouldn't be standing here so proud, so

(Hey!) Kiss me once 'cause I know you had a long night
(Oh!) Kiss you twice 'cause it's gonna be alright

Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar
""I rent a place on Cornelia Street""
I say casually in the car
We were a fresh page on the desk
Filling in the blanks as we go
As if the street lights pointed in an arrowhead
Leading us home

And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kind of heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

Windows swung right open, autumn air
Jacket 'round my shoulders is yours
We bless the rains on Cornelia Street
Memorize the creaks in the floor
Back when we were card sharks, playing games
I thought you were leading me on
I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street
Before you even knew I was gone

But then you called, showed your hand
I turned around before I hit the tunnel
Sat on the roof, you and I

I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kind of heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name (city screams your name)
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

You hold my hand on the street
Walk me back to that apartment
Years ago, we were just inside
Barefoot in the kitchen
Sacred new beginnings
That became my religion, listen

I hope I never lose you

Oh, never again

And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away

I get drunk, but it's not enough
'Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier still flickering here
'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts

I dress to kill my time
I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
They say, ""I don't know""
And what once was ours
Is no one's now
I see you everywhere, the only thing we share
Is this small town
You said it was a great love
One for the ages
But if the story's over, why am I still writing pages?

Gave up on me like I was a bad drug
Now I'm searching for signs in a haunted club
Our songs, our films, united, we stand
Our country, guess it was a lawless land
Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand
Paper cut stings from our paper-thin plans
My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust
Tryna find a part of me you didn't take up
Gave you so much, but it wasn't enough
But I'll be alright, it's just a thousand cuts

I get drunk, but it's not enough
'Cause you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up

Alright

I love my hometown as much as Motown, I love SoCal
And you know I love Springsteen, faded blue jeans, Tennessee whiskey
But something happened, I heard him laughing
I saw the dimples first and then I heard the accent
They say home is where the heart is
But that's not where mine lives

You know I love a London boy
I enjoy walking Camden Market in the afternoon
He likes my American smile
Like a child when our eyes meet, darling, I fancy you
Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true
You know I love a London boy
Boy, I fancy you (ooh)

And now I love high tea, stories from uni, and the West End
You can find me in the pub, we are watching rugby with his school friends
Show me a gray sky, a rainy cab ride
Babe, don't threaten me with a good time
They say home is where the heart is
But God, I love the English

You know I love a London boy
I enjoy nights in Brixton, Shoreditch in the afternoon
He likes my American smile

Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates

You know I love a London boy

Crazy to think that this could work

We were stupid to jump
In the ocean separating us
Remember how I'd fly to you?

And I can't talk to you when you're like this
Staring out the window like I'm not your favorite town
I'm New York City
I still do it for you, babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
When you're led by blind faith
Blind faith

But we might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship
We might just get away with it

Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship this love

I know heaven's a thing
I go there when you touch me, honey
Hell is when I fight with you
But we can patch it up good
Make confessions and we're begging for forgiveness
Got the wine for you

And you can't talk to me when I'm like this
Daring you to leave me just so I can try and scare you
You're the West Village
You still do it for me, babe

But you say it in a Tweet, that's a cop-out
And I'm just like, ""Hey, are you okay?""

Why are you mad?
When you could be GLAAD? (You could be GLAAD)
Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark age
Just makin' that sign must've taken all night

You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace
And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate
'Cause shade never made anybody less gay

Everyone looked worse in the light
There are so many lines that I've crossed, unforgiven
I'll tell you truth, but never, ""Goodbye""

I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
I've been sleepin' so long in a twenty-year dark night
And now I see daylight, I only see daylight

Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
And so I became the butt of the joke
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
Clearin' the air, I breathed in the smoke

Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now
It's brighter now, now

And I can still see it all (in my mind)

Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats

Searchin' for a sound we hadn't heard before
And it said

Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

The lights are so bright but they never blind me, me

It's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors
Took our broken hearts, put them in a drawer
Everybody here was someone else before
And you can want who you want
Boys and boys and girls and girls

Welcome to New York

/lyric/35454525/Taylor+Swift/Mean,Mean,"You, with your words like knives 
And swords and weapons that you use against me
You, have knocked me off my feet again, 
Got me feeling like a nothing
You, with your voice like nails 
On a chalk board, calling me out when I'm wounded
You, picking on the weaker man

You can take me down 
With just one single blow 
But you don't know what you don't know

Someday I'll be living in a big old city 
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me 
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

You, with your switching sides 
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again 
As if I don't already see them
I walk with my head down, 
Try to block you out 'cause I never impress you
I just want to feel okay again

I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you cold but the cycle ends right now 
'Cause you can't lead me down that road 
And you don't know what you don't know

Someday I'll be living in a big old city 
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me 
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

And I can see you years from now in a bar
Talking over a football game 
With that same big loud opinion
But nobody's listening, washed up and ranting 
About the same old bitter things
Drunk and rumbling on about how I can't sing 
But all you are is mean
All you are is mean and a liar and pathetic
And alone in life and mean, and mean, and mean, and mean

But someday I'll be living in a big old city 
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Yeah someday I'll be big enough

The smiles, the flowers, everything
Is gone
Yesterday I found out about you
Even now just looking at you
Feels wrong
You say that you'd take it all back
Given one chance; it was a moment of weakness
And you said ""yes""

You should've said no
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice before you let it all go
You should've known that word like what you did with her
Would get back to me (get back to me)
And I should've been there
In the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be beggin' for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no
Baby, and you might still have me

You can see that I've been cryin'
Baby, you know all the right things
To say
But do you, honestly
Expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?
You say that the past is the past
You need one chance; it was a moment of weakness

And I'm a house of cards
You're the kind of reckless that should send me running
But I kinda know that I won't get far

And you stood there in front of me just
Close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see
What I was thinking of

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see, sparks fly, whenever you smile

Get me with those green eyes, baby
As the lights go down
Gimme something that'll haunt me whenever you're not around
'Cause I see, sparks fly, when you smile

My mind forgets to remind me, your a bad idea
You touch me once and it's really something
You find I'm even better than you, imagined I would be
I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you I know its no good
And I could wait patiently
But I really wish you would

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain

Get me with those green eyes, baby

Gimme something that'll haunt me when you're not around

I run my fingers through your hair
And watch the lights go wild
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me
Its just wrong enough to make it feel right
And lead me up the staircase
Won't you whisper soft and slow
And I'm captivated by you baby
Like a fireworks show

Then you come around again and say

Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, I hate you, we break up, you call me, I love you

And me, falling for it screaming that I'm right
And you, would hide away and find your peace of mind

People would say, ""they're the lucky ones""

I used to know my place was a spot next to you
Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat
'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on

Oh, a simple complication
Miscommunications lead to fall out
So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up I can't break through

Now I'm standing alone In a crowded room
And we're not speaking and I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down and the story of us
Looks a lot like a tragedy now next chapter

How'd we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes
And trying to look busy
And you're doing your best to avoid me
I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us
How I was losing my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride like you should have held me
Oh, I'm scared to see the ending
Why are we pretending this is nothing?

But I would lay my armor down

Strangers silence makes me want to take the stairs,
If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares,
But right now, 
My time is theirs.

Seems like there's always
Someone who disapproves,
They'll judge it like they know about me and you,
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do,
The jury's out,
And my choice is you.

So don't you worry your pretty little mind,
People throw rocks at things that shine,
And life makes love look hard,
The stakes are high,
The waters rough,
But this love is ours,

You never know what people have up their sleeves,
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me,
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles,
But I don't care,
'Cause right now you're mine,
And you say,

So don't you worry your pretty little mind,

My belong in,
I'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you.

And I love the riddles that you speak,
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored,

I'm reaching out and I just can't tell you why

I'm caught up in you
I'm caught up in you

And when you're close I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night

It's like a million little stars
Spelling out your name
You gotta come on, come on
Say that we'll be together
Come on, come on
Little taste of heaven

It's half full and I won't wait here all day
I know you're saying that you'll be here anyway

But you're untouchable
Burning brighter than the sun

I love it too 'cause you my type
You hold me down and I protect you with my life

Knew her when I was young
Reconnected when we were little bit older
Both sprung, I got issues and chips on both of my shoulders
Reputation precedes me, in rumors I'm knee deep
The truth is it's easier to ignore it, believe me
Even when we'd argue, we don't do it for long
And you understand the good and bad, end up in the song
For all your beautiful traits, and the way you do it with ease
For all my flaws, paranoia, and insecurities
I've made mistakes, and made some choices that's hard to deny
After the storm, something was born on the fourth of July
I've passed days without fun, this endgame is the one
With four words on the tip of my tongue, I'll never say

I don't wanna touch you (I don't wanna be)
Just anther ex-love (You don't wanna see)

I swear I don't love the drama, it loves me
And I can't let you go, your hand print's on my soul

/lyric/35093979/Taylor+Swift/Red,Red,"Loving him is like 
Driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind
Passionate as sin
Ending so suddenly
Loving him is like
Trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright
Just before they lose it all

Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red (re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)
(Re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)
Loving him was red (re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)
(Re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)

Touching him was like
Realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as
Easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like
Trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like
Wishing you never found out that love could be that strong

Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red (re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)
Oh, red (re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)
Burning red (re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)
(Re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)

Remembering him comes in flashbacks
And echoes
Tell myself it's time now
Gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Burning it was red

Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
'Cause loving him was red (re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)

Men just for you
Time moved too fast
You played it back
Buttons on a coat
Light hearted joke
No proof not much
But you saw enough
Small talk, he drives
Coffee at midnight, the light reflects
The chain on your neck
He says look up
And your shoulders brush
No proof, one touch
You felt enough

You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love
You are in love

Morning, his place
Burnt toast, Sunday
You keep his shirt
He keeps his word
And for once you let go
Of your fears and your ghosts
One step, not much, but it said enough
You kissed on sidewalks
You fight and you talk
One night he wakes, strange look on his face
Pauses, then says, you're my best friend
And you knew what it was, he is in love

You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you
You can see it with the lights out, lights out
You are in love, true love

So it goes
You two are dancing in a snow globe, go round and round
And he keeps the picture of you in his office downtown
You understand now why they lost their minds and fought the wars
And why I've spent my whole life try to put it into words

'Cause you can hear in the silence
You can feel it on the way home
You can see it with the lights out
You are in love, true love
You're in love

You can hear it in the silence, silence, you
You can feel it on the way home, way home, you

And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter cause you're dreaming
So I tuck you in and turn on your favorite nightlight

To you, everything's funny
You got nothing to regret
I'd give all I have honey
If you could stay like that

Oh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up
Just stay this little
Oh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up
It could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart
No one will desert you
Just try to never grow up
Never grow up

You're in the car on the way to the movies
And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
At fourteen, there's just so much you can't do
And you can't wait to move out
Someday and call your own shots

But don't make her drop you off around the block
Remember that she's getting older too
And don't lose the way that you dance around in your p.j.s getting ready for school

Oh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up
Just stay this little
Oh darling don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up
It could stay this simple
And no one's ever burned you
Nothing's ever left you scarred
And even though you want to
Just try to never grow up

Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
And all your little brother's favorite songs
I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone

So here I am in my new apartment
In a big city, they just dropped me off
It's so much colder than I thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and turn my nightlight on

Wish I'd never grown up
I wish I'd never grown up
Oh I don't wanna grow up
Wish I'd never grown up

Oh I don't wanna grow up
Wish I'd never grown up

I don't regret it one bit, 'cause he had it coming

They say I did something bad
Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did something bad
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good

I never trust a playboy
But they love me
So I fly him all around the world
And I let them think they saved me
They never see it comin'
What I do next
This is how the world works
You gotta leave before you get left

I can feel the flames on my skin
He says, ""Don't throw away a good thing""
But if he drops my name, then I owe him nothin'
And if he spends my change, then he had it comin'

They say I did something bad
Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did something bad
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good

It just felt so good

They're burning all the witches, even if you aren't one
They got their pitchforks and proof
Their receipts and reasons
They're burning all the witches, even if you aren't one
So light me up (light me up), light me up (light me up)
Light me up, go ahead and light me up (light me up)
Light me up (light me up), light me up (light me up)
Light me up (light me up), light me up (light me up)

They say I did something bad
Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did something bad
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good

Oh, you say I did something bad

Back against the wall
Trippin', trip-trippin' when you're gone

'Cause we break down a little
And when you get me alone, it's so simple
'Cause baby, I know what you know

And I'm yours to lose

Do bad things with you

All eyes on us

Wear you like a necklace

You should take it as a compliment
That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk
You should think about the consequence
Of your magnetic field being a little too strong
And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us
He's in the club doing, I don't know what
You're so cool, it makes me hate you so much (I hate you so much)

Whisky on ice, Sunset and Vine
You've ruined my life, by not being mine

You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face
'Cause look at your face
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way
But, what can I say?
You're gorgeous

You should take it as a compliment
That I'm talking to everyone here but you (but you, but you)
And you should think about the consequence
Of you touching my hand in the darkened room (dark room, dark room)
If you've got a girlfriend, I'm jealous of her
But if you're single that's honestly worse
'Cause you're so gorgeous it actually hurts

He was the best of times, the worst of crimes
I struck a match 
And blew your mind, but I didn't mean it
And you didn't see it
The ties were black, the lies were white
And shades of grey in candlelight
I wanted to leave him
I needed a reason

X marks the spot
Where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, I was lyin' to myself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed
We never had a shotgun shot in the dark

You were drivin' 
The getaway car
We were flyin'
But we'd never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
We're ridin' 
In a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me

In a getaway car, oh-oh
No, they never get far, oh-oh-ahh
No, nothing good starts 
In a getaway car

It was the great escape
The prison break
The light of freedom on my face
But you weren't thinkin'
And I was just drinkin'
While he was runnin' after us
I was screamin', ""Go, go, go!""
But with three of us, honey, it's a side show
And a circus ain't a love story
And now we're both sorry
(We're both sorry)

X marks the spot

Every man for himself

Until I switched to the other side
To the other si-i-i-i-ide
It's no surprise I turned you in (ohh)
'Cause us traitors never win

I left you in a motel bar
Put the money in a bag and I stole the keys

They've got no idea about me and you
There is an indentation in the shape of you
Made your mark on me, a golden tattoo

My hands are shaking from holding back from you (ah, ah, ah)
All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting
My hands are shaking from holding back from all this (ha, ha, ha, ha)

Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off (ha, ha, ha)
Carve your name into my bedpost
'Cause I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off (ha, ha, ha, ha)

Inescapable, I'm not even gonna try
And if I get burned, at least we were electrified
I'm spilling wine in the bathtub, you kiss my face and we're both drunk
Everyone thinks that they know us, but they know nothing about

My rebounds, my earthquakes
Even in my worst lies, you saw the truth of me
And I woke up just in time
Now I wake up by your side
My one and only, my lifeline
I woke up just in time
Now I wake up by your side
My hands shake, I can't explain this (ha, ha, ha, ha)

Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off, take it off (ha, ha, ha, ha)
Carve your name into my bedpost
'Cause I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off, take it off (ha, ha, ha, ha)

There is an indentation
In the shape of you
Only bought this dress so you could take it off

I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

I can tell that it's going to be a long road
I'll be there if you're the toast of the town babe
Or if you strike out and you're crawling home

Wonder how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom
Holdin' him for ransom
Some, some boys are tryin' too hard
He don't try at all, though
Younger than my exes but he act like such a man, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta

I-I-I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone

In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby, mmm
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you
So I take my time
Are you ready for it?

Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealing hearts and running off and never saying sorry
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist
And we'll move to an island, and
And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor
Every lover known in comparison is a failure
I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now
Never be the same now, now

/lyric/34570122/Taylor+Swift/Call+It+What+You+Want,Call It What You Want,"My castle crumbled overnight
I brought a knife to a gunfight
They took the crown, but it's alright
All the liars are calling me one
Nobody's heard from me for months
I'm doing better than I ever was, 'cause

My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
So call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
So call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to

All my flowers grew back as thorns
Windows boarded up after the storm
He built a fire just to keep me warm
All the drama queens taking swings
All the jokers dressin' up as kings
They fade to nothing when I look at him
And I know I make the same mistakes every time
Bridges burn, I never learn, at least I did one thing right
I did one thing right
I'm laughing with my lover, making forts under covers
Trust him like a brother, yeah, you know I did one thing right
Starry eyes sparkin' up my darkest night

My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
So call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
So call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to

I want to wear his initial
On a chain round my neck, chain round my neck
Not because he owns me
But 'cause he really knows me
Which is more than they can say, I
I recall late November, holdin' my breath
Slowly I said, ""You don't need to save me
But would you run away with me?""
Yes (would you run away?)

My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
So call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene

/lyric/34471769/Taylor+Swift/Big+Star,Big Star,"She was aware of her insecurities as she took the stage
She was convinced if she got up there
That she would be discovered someday
So she belted it, she hit the high notes fearlessly
Oh she melted then, as she brought them to their feet

She was a big star at Banana Joe's Bar
Where she sang karaoke every night
She said, ""If you work hard to get where you are
It feels good in the hot spotlight""
She was a big star

She made the local cable shows where the camera fell in love with her face
After a couple of weekends the groupies were crawlin' all over the place
She signed autographs like she was Garth Brooks in a skirt
And in the aftermath, that small time town was hers

She was a big star at Banana Joe's Bar
Where she sang karaoke every night
She said, ""If you work hard to get where you are
It feels good in the hot spotlight""
She was a big star

She doesn't care anymore that her high school girlfriends cut her down
They only thought she entertain is where they are and where she is now

All her old neighbors swear they're certain she slept her way to the top
She knows you don't get where your going
Unless you got something they ain't got
So she sings tonight to 20,000 plus
And the young girls scream out loud, ""Man that could be us""

She's a big star and she eats caviar
Just before she performs every night

But something 'bout it felt like home somehow and I
Left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you still got it in your drawer even now

Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay
But I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over me
Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-size bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on a tee ball team
You tell me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me

And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We dance around the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well, yeah

Maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well

Hey, you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all too well

Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone

But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it, 'cause you remember it all too well, yeah

'Cause there we are again, when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known

And she's got everything that I have to live without

That I can't even see anyone when he's with me
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right,
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

Drew walks by me, can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly,
The kind of flawless I wish I could be
She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky cause

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

So I drive home alone, as I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down and maybe
Get some sleep tonight

Because he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

/lyric/35890781/Taylor+Swift/Our+Song,Our Song,"I was riding shotgun with my hair undone in the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, ""Baby, is something wrong?""
I say, ""Nothin', I was just thinkin' how we don't have a song""
And he said,

Our song is a slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone, and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh, on the first date
Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have
And when I got home, before I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again

I was walking up the front porch steps after everything that day
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said,

Our song is a slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone, and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh, on the first date
Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have
And when I got home, before I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again

I've heard every album, listened to the radio
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song

'Cause our song is a slamming screen door
Sneaking out late, tapping on his window
When we're on the phone, and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late, and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs, on the first date
Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have
And when I got home, before I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again
Play it again, oh yeah, oh, oh, yeah

I was riding shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
And I wrote down our song",Taylor_Swift,ride get look turn say say thinkin say slam tap talk because know laugh kiss should get say ask could play walk go trample lose throw get notice say slam tap talk because know laugh kiss should get say ask could play hear listen wait come because slam sneak tap talk because know laugh kiss should get say ask could play play ride grab write,shotgun hair undone seat car hand feel steering wheel heart radio baby song song screen door window phone mama song way date porch step day hallway way bed rose note song screen door window phone mama song way date album radio song song screen door window phone mama song way date shotgun hair undone seat car pen napkin song,around just how out late when real slow when home again all well almost out late when real slow when home again as late when real slow when home again again,ride shotgun hair undone seat car get hand feel steering wheel heart look turn radio say baby wrong nothing thinkin song say song slam screen door Sneakin late tap window phone talk real slow because late mama know song way laugh date man kiss get home say amen ask God play walk porch step day go wrong trample lose throw away get hallway way love bed notice rose note say song slam screen door Sneakin late tap window phone talk real slow because late mama know song way laugh date man kiss get home say amen ask God play hear album listen radio wait come good song because song slam screen door sneak late tap window phone talk real slow because late mama know song way laugh date man kiss get home say amen ask God play play oh yeah oh oh yeah ride shotgun hair undone seat car grab pen old napkin write song

/lyric/35890779/Taylor+Swift/I+Knew+You+Were+Trouble.,I Knew You Were Trouble.,"Once upon time
A few mistakes ago
I was in your sights
You got me alone
You found me
You found me
You found me
I guess you didn't care
And I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard
You took a step back
Without me, without me, without me
And he's long gone
When he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
So you put me down oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

Double platinum wherever she go
Shout to French Torino
Met her out in Vegas
I'm not in no casino
Red lips so hard to miss
What's wrong with being promiscuous
And I can teach you bad bad things
If you into it
Don't need to get intimate
Just yet
Slow down I know that you're thinking you and me
Just met
But girl I got the remedy
Most important the chemistry
Good girl gone bad
Too much for a Kennedy
So, some say some say they sold their souls for a couple hits
I'd rather live the life of gold with the perfect chick
'Cause that one moment so breathless and you're hoping
That you'll feel the same way same way
Sparks glowing off that cute face and that sharp smile
Oh man
I haven't crushed this hard in quite awhile
Oh dang
And I could care less that you famous
We gon' make the perfect couple
'Cause my first name Big
Last name Trouble

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
So you put me down oh

Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

When your saddest fear comes creeping in
That you never loved me or her or anyone or anything
Yeah

Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know
Is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds
Or fades in time

And I never 
(Never)
Saw you coming
And I'll never
(Never)
Be the same

You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannon ball
Now all we know
Is don't let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs
Four blue eyes

So you were never a saint
And I loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is great and wild

And I never (oh-oh, oh-oh, ouh-ooh)

This is the worth while fight
Love is a ruthless game

You're my Achilles heel

/lyric/35890764/Taylor+Swift/Enchanted,Enchanted,"There I was again tonight forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you

Your eyes whispered ""have we met?""
Across the room your silhouette starts to make it's way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks, like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonder struck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

The lingering question kept me up
Two a.m., who do you love?
I wonder till I'm wide awake
Now I'm pacing back and forth, wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say, hey
It was enchanting to meet you
All I know is I was, enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonder struck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonder struck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

This is me praying that this was the very first page
Not where the story line ends
My thoughts will echo your name, until I see you again
These are the words I held back, as I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you

Please don't have somebody waiting on you
Please don't be in love with someone else

/lyric/35890761/Taylor+Swift/Out+of+the+Woods,Out of the Woods,"Looking at it now
It all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch
I remember
You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered (then discovered)
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color
And I remember thinking

Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet, good

Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet, good

Are we out of the woods

Looking at it now
Last December (last December)
We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together (back together)
Ooh your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldn't quite forget
When we decided (we decided) to move the furniture so we could dance
Baby, like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying
And I remember thinking

Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet, good

Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet? In the clear yet, good

Are we out of the woods?

Remember when you hit the brakes too soon
Twenty stitches in a hospital room
When you started crying baby, I did too
But when the sun came up I was looking at you
Remember when we couldn't take the heat
I walked out, I said, I'm setting you free
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
When the sun came up you were looking at me

You were looking at me
Oh!
You were looking at me

Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods? (I remember)
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?

/lyric/35890760/Taylor+Swift/Come+Back...Be+Here,Come Back...Be Here,"You said it in a simple way
4AM, the second day
How strange that I don't know you at all
Stumbled through the long goodbye
One last kiss, then catch your flight
Right when I was just about to fall

I told myself, don't get attached
But in my mind I play it back
Spinning faster than the plane that took you

And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here
Come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today
I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here
Come back, be here

The delicate beginning rush
The feeling you can know so much
Without knowing anything at all
And now that I can put this down
If I had known what I know now
I never would have played so nonchalant

Taxi cabs and busy streets
That never bring you back to me
I can't help but wish you took me with you

And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here
Come back, be here
I guess you're in London today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here
Come back, be here

(Aah) ah-ah, oh-oh
Ah-ah, oh-oh
(Aah) ah-ah, oh-oh

This is falling in love in the cruelest way
This is falling for you and you are worlds away

New York, be here
But you're in London and I break down
'Cause it's not fair that you're not around

This is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here
Come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today
And I don't wanna need you this way

High tide, came and brought you in

And I will, skies grow darker, currents swept you out again
And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone
In silent screams, and wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this

This love is a life back from the dead, oh

And this love came back to me, oh

And I could go on and on, on and on

But you were still gone, gone, gone
Been losing grip, on sinking ships
You showed up, just in time

/lyric/35890757/Taylor+Swift/The+Lucky+One,The Lucky One,"New to town with a made up name
In the Angel city, chasing fortune and fame
And the camera flashes, make it look like a dream
You had it figured out since you were in school
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool
So overnight you look like a sixties' queen

Another name goes up in lights
Like diamonds in the sky

And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
But can you tell me now, you're the lucky one, oh, oh, oooh

Now it's big black cars, and Riviera views
And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page

And they tell you that you're lucky
But you're so confused
'Cause you don't feel pretty
You just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place

Another name goes up in lights
You wonder if you'll make it out alive

And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Can you tell me now, you're the lucky one

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, ooh, oh-oh-ooh

It was a few years later
I showed up here
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
How you took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
Chose the Rose Garden over Madison Square
And it took some time, but I understand it now

'Cause now my name is up in lights
But I think you got it right

Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one

'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
People are people,
And sometimes we change our minds
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time

Music starts playin' like the end of a sad movie,
It's the kinda ending you don't really wanna see
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down,
Now I don't know what to be without you around

And we know it's never simple,
Never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand,

And I can't,
Breathe,
Without you,
But I have to,
Breathe,
Without you,
But I have to

Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt
Every little bump in the road I tried to swerve
People are people,
And sometimes it doesn't work out,
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out

He didn't like it when I wore high heels, but I do
Turned the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song but I do, I do

Walked in expecting you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wait
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is, but I do

And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months thinking all love ever does
Is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a café I watched it begin again

You said you never met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you, but I do
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm coming off a little shy, but I do

But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months thinking all love ever does
Is break and burn and end
But on a wednesday in a café I watched it begin again

And we walk down the block to my car
And I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about the movies
That your family watches
Every single Christmas and I won't
Talk about that
And for the first time
What's past is past

'Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did

But you are not the kind of boy,
Who should be marryin' the wrong girl

And her snotty little family, all dressed in pastel,
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid,
Somewhere back inside a room,
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry,
This is surely not what you thought it would be,
I lose myself in a daydream,
Where I stand and say

""Don't say yes, run away now,
I'll meet you when you're out,
Of the church at the back door,
Don't wait or say a single vow,
You need to hear me out,""
And they said, ""Speak now""

Fond gestures are exchanged,
And the organ starts to play
A song that sounds like a death march,
And I am hiding in the curtains,
It seems I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be,
She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen,
But I know you wish it was me,
You wish it was me, don't you?

""Speak now or forever hold your peace,""

I stand up with shaking hands,

Horrified looks from everyone in the room,
But I'm only lookin' at you

Fell down the rabbit hole
You held on tight to me
'Cause nothing's as it seems
Spinning out of control
Didn't they tell us don't rush into things
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me
Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds
Ooh didn't it all seem new and exciting
I felt your arms twisting around me
I should've slept with one eye opened at night

Too in love to think straight
All alone or so it seemed
But there were strangers watching
And whispers turned to talking
And talking turned to screams

Didn't they tell us don't rush into things
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me
Didn't you call my fears with the treacherous cat's smile
Ooh didn't it all seem new and exciting
I felt your arms twisting around me
It's all fun and games, still somebody loses their mind

It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place
Was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight

I met Bobby on the boardwalk summer of '45
Picked me up late one night out the window
We were seventeen and crazy running wild, wild
Can't remember what song he was playing when we walked in
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince

And I said, ""Oh my, what a marvelous tune""
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place
Was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

He said, ""Look at you, worrying so much about things you can't change
You'll spend your whole life singing the blues
If you keep thinking that way""
He was tryna to skip rocks on the ocean saying to me
""Don't you see the starlight, starlight
Don't you dream impossible things""

Like, ""Oh my, what a marvelous tune""
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place
Was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

Jumping to the pool from the balcony
Everyone swimming in a champagne sea
And there are no rules when you show up here
Bass beat rattling the chandelier
Feeling so Gatsby for that whole year

So why'd you have to rain on my parade?
I'm shaking my head
I'm locking the gates

This is why we can't have nice things, darling
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice things, honey
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things

It was so nice being friends again
There I was giving you a second chance
But you stabbed my back while shaking my hand
And therein lies the issue
Friends don't try to trick you
Get you on the phone and mind-twist you
And so I took an axe to a mended fence

But I'm not the only friend you've lost lately, hm hm
If only you weren't
So shady

This is why we can't have nice things, darling
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice (nice things)
Things (baby) honey
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have

Here's a toast to my real friends
They don't care about that he said, she said
And here's to my baby
He ain't reading what they call me lately
And here's to my momma
Had to listen to all this drama
And here's to you
'Cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do
I can't even say it with a straight face

This is why we can't have nice things, darling (darling)
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice things, honey
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things, darling
(And here's to my real friends)
Because you break them, I want to take them

I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play? Ayy
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny, rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dyin' to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames

They'll tell you I'm insane

But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king, baby, I'm your queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh no
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessin' like
""Oh my God, who is she?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave

I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall
Superstar

Good morning loneliness
Comes around when I'm not dreaming about you
When my world wakes up today you'll be in another town
And I knew when I saw your face I'd be
Counting down the ways to see you
And you smile that beautiful smile
And all the girls in the front row scream your name

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall
Superstar

You played in bars, you play guitar
And I'm invisible and everyone knows who you are
And you'll never see, you sing me to sleep
Every night from the radio

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall

/lyric/31979975/Taylor+Swift/The+Moment+I+Knew,The Moment I Knew,"You should've been there
Should've burst through the door
With that ""Baby, I'm right here"" smile
And it would've felt like
A million little shining stars had just aligned
And I would've been so happy

Christmas lights glisten
I've got my eye on the door
Just waiting for you to walk in
But the time is ticking
People ask me how I've been
As I comb back through my memory
How you said you'd be here
You said you'd be here

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
As I'm looking around the room
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew

And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone
But your close friends always seem to know
When there's something really wrong
So they follow me down the hall
And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart
And the sinking feeling starts
As I say hopelessly
""He said he'd be here""

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
And asking me about you
But there was one thing missing (missing, missing)
And that was the moment I knew

What do you say, when tears are streaming down your face
In front of everyone you know?
And what do you do when the one who means the most to you
Is the one who didn't show?

You should've been here
And I would've been so happy

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all standing around me singing
""Happy birthday to you""
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew
Ooh, I knew
Ooh

You called me later
And said, ""I'm sorry, I didn't make it""
And I said, ""I'm sorry too""
And that was the moment I knew",Taylor_Swift,should Should burst smile would feel shine align would glisten get wait walk tick ask comb say 'd say 'd stand impress laugh look miss know pass wanna seem know follow try fall sink say say 'd stand impress laugh ask miss miss know say stream know mean show should would stand impress stand singe miss know know call say make say know,door star light eye door time People memory motion party dress lipstick one room thing moment hour friend hall bathroom feeling start motion party dress lipstick one thing moment tear face front one motion party dress lipstick one birthday thing moment moment,there here just so just how back how here here there by now just always when really so there apart hopelessly here there when when here so there later too, burst door Baby right smile feel like million little shine star align happy Christmas light glisten get eye door wait walk time tick People ask comb memory say say like slow motion stand party dress red lipstick impress laugh look room thing miss moment know hour pass wanna close friend know wrong follow hall bathroom try fall apart sink feeling start hopelessly say like slow motion stand party dress red lipstick impress laugh ask thing miss missing miss moment know tear stream face know mean happy like slow motion stand party dress red lipstick impress stand singe happy birthday thing miss moment know ooh know ooh call later say sorry say sorry moment know

Takes me home, lights are off he's taking off his coat (Hm yeah)
I say ""I've heard that you've been out and about with some other girl, some other girl""
He says ""What you've heard is true but I
Can't stop thinking about you"" and I

Windows down, I pass my street
The memories start

You say it's in the past
And drive straight ahead
You think I'm gonna hate you now
'Cause you still don't know what I never said

I wish you would come back
Wish I'd never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I'd live

And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good
I wish you would

It's 2 A.M. in my room
Headlights pass the window pane
I think of you

We're a crooked love
In a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
Then it makes you turn right back around

I wish you would come back
Wish I'd never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I'd live

And I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good
I wish you would

I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for
Wish you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad anymore

See your face
Hear my voice in the dark

In a straight line down
Guess you wanna run and hide
But it made us turn right back around

When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
It was months, and months of back and forth, ah ah
You're still all over me like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore
Hung my head, as I lost the war, and the sky turned black like a perfect storm

Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning, gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean

There was nothing left to do, ah ah
When the butterflies turned to dust, they covered my whole room
So I punched a hole in the roof, ah ah
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you
The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud but no one heard a thing

Rain came pouring down when I was drowning
That's when I could finally breathe
And by morning, gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
I think I am finally clean, ah
Said, I think I am finally clean, ah

Ten months sober, I must admit
Just because you're clean don't mean you don't miss it
Ten months older I won't give in
Now that I'm clean I'm never gonna risk it

Is I know something now
Know something now I didn't before

Is green eyes and freckles and your smile

I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now

And everything has changed

You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

And all my walls
Stood tall painted blue
But I'll take 'em down, take 'em down
And open up the door for you
And all I feel
In my stomach is butterflies

Takin' flight, makin' me feel like

A few mistakes ago
I was in your sights
You got me alone
You found me
You found me
You found me
I guess you didn't care
And I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard
You took a step back
Without me
Without me
Without me

And he's long gone
When he's next to me
And I realize
The blame is on me

'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So, shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lyin' on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble

No apologies
He'll never see you cry
Pretend he doesn't know
That he's the reason why
You're drowning
You're drowning
You're drowning
And I heard you moved on
From whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt
Is all I'll ever be
And now I see
Now I see
Now I see

He was long gone
When he met me

/lyric/28642997/Taylor+Swift/Stay+Stay+Stay,Stay Stay Stay,"I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room at you
I was expecting some dramatic turn away
But you stayed
This morning I said we should talk about it
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet
And said, ""Okay, let's talk""
And I said

Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay

Before you, I'd only dated self indulgent takers
Who took all of their problem out on me
But you carry my groceries and now I'm always laughing
And I love you, because you have given me no choice but to

Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay
Stay, stay, stay

You took the time to memorize me
My fears, my hopes and dreams
I just like hanging out with you
All the time
All those times that you didn't leave
It's been occurring to me
I'd like to hang out with you
For my whole life

Stay
And I'll be loving you for quite some time
No one else is gonna love me when I get mad, mad, mad
So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay

And you open your eyes into mine
And everything feels better

And right before your eyes
I'm breaking
No past, no reasons why
Just you and me

You wear your best apology
But I was there to watch you leave
And all the times I let you in
Just for you to go again
Disappear when you come back
Everything is better

And right before your eyes
I'm aching
Run fast, nowhere to hide
Just you and me

/lyric/28642995/Taylor+Swift/Holy+Ground,Holy Ground,"I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone and Lord, it took me away
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time
Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a the green light, go
Hey, you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
And that was the first day

And darlin', it was good
Never lookin' down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

Spinnin' like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big wide city all to ourselves
We blocked the noise with the sound of ""I need you""
And for the first time I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story's got dust on every page
But sometimes I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd

'Cause darlin', it was good (uh-ey, uh-ey)
Never lookin' down (uh-ey, uh-ey)
And right there where we stood (uh-ey)
Was holy ground (uh-ey, uh-ey, uh-ey, oh-oh)
(Uh-ey, uh-ey, uh-ey, oh-oh)

Tonight I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
Tonight I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you

Words, how little they mean
When you're a little too late

Your face in a locket
Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait

We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair

In dreams
I meet you in warm conversation
We both wake
In lonely beds
In different cities
And time
Is taking its sweet time erasing you
And you've got your demons
And darlin' they all look like me

And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night, you looked me in the eye and told me you loved me

Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me, this thing is breaking down
We almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby what happened? Please tell me

'Cause one second it was perfect, now you're halfway out the door

[Chorus]
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always

Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure

So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence, that cuts me to the core
Where is this going? Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore

You didn't mean it baby, I don't think so

Oh back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?

/lyric/28200001/Taylor+Swift/Red+%5BOriginal+Demo%5D+%5BDemo+Version%5D,Red [Original Demo] [Demo Version],"Loving him is like 
Driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind
Passionate as sin
Ending so suddenly
Loving him is like
Trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright
Just before they lose it all

Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red (re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)
(Re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)
Red (re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)
(Re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)

Touching him was like
Realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as
Easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like
Trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like
Wishing you never found out that love could be that strong

Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red (re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)
(Re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)
Loving him was red (re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)
(Re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)

Remembering him comes in flashbacks
And echoes
Tell myself it's time now
Gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red (re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)
(Burning it was red) (re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)
Burning red (re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)

Loving him was red (re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)

/lyric/27995267/Taylor+Swift/Ronan,Ronan,"I remember your bare feet down the hallway
I remember your little laugh
Race cars on the kitchen floor
Plastic dinosaurs, I love you to the moon and back

I remember your blue eyes looking into mine like we had our own secret club
I remember you dancing before bed time then jumping on me waking me up
I can still feel you hold my hand
Little man, from even that moment I knew
You fought it hard like an army guy
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you

Come on baby with me
We're gonna fly away from here
You were my best four years

I remember the drive home when the blind hope
Turned to crying and screaming, ""Why?""
Flowers piled up in the worst way
No one knows what to say about a beautiful boy who died

And it's about to be Halloween
You could be anything you wanted if you were still here

I remember the last day when I kissed your face
I whispered in your ear

Come on baby with me
We're gonna fly away from here
Out of this curtained room in this hospital
We'll just disappear
Come on baby with me
We're gonna fly away from here
You were my best four years

What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?
What if I kept the hand me downs you won't grow into?
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?
But what if the miracle was even getting one moment with you

Come on baby with me
We're gonna fly away from here
Come on baby with me
We're gonna fly away from here

You'll be alright, no one can hurt you now
Come morning light, you and I'll be safe and sound

Don't you dare look out your window, darling everything's on fire
The war outside our door keeps raging on

/lyric/28828209/Taylor+Swift/Both+of+Us,Both of Us,"I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both of us
Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us

Ever thought about losing it
When your money's all gone and you lose your whip
You might lose your grip when the landlord tell ya that you're due for rent
And the grass so green on the other side
Make a n**** wanna run straight through the fence
Open up the fridge bout twenty times
But still can't find no food in it
That's foolishness
And sometimes I wonder, why we care so much about the way we look
And the way we talk and the way we act
And the clothes we bought, how much that cost?
Does it even really matter?
'Cause if life is an uphill battle
We all tryna climb with the same ol' ladder
In the same boat, with the same ol' paddle
Why so shallow? I'm just asking
What's the pattern for the madness
Everybody ain't a number one draft pick
Most of us ain't Hollywood actors
But if it's all for one, and one for all
Then maybe one day, we all can ball
Do it one time for the underdogs
Sincerely yours, from one of y'all

I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both of us
Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us

I can feel your pain, I can feel your struggle
You just wanna live, been everything so low
That you could drown in a puddle
That's why I gotta hold us up, yeah hold us up
For all the times no one's ever spoke for us
To every single time that they play this song
You can say that that's what Bobby Ray wrote for us
When the tides get too high
And the sea up underneath get so deep
And you feel like you're just another person
Getting lost in the crowd, way up high in the nosebleed
Uh, because we won't be near yet, both of us
But we still stand tall with our shoulders up
And even though we always against the odds
These are the things that have molded us
And if life hadn't chosen us
Sometimes I wonder where I would've wound up
'Cause if it was up to me, I'd make a new blueprint
Then build it from the ground up, hey
But if it's all for one, and one for all
Then maybe one day, we all can ball
Do it one time for the underdogs
From Bobby Ray, to all of y'all

Dreaming dreams with happy endings
In backyards, winning battles with our wooden swords
But now we've stepped into a cruel world
Where everybody stands and keeps score

Every lesson forms a new scar

Free to roam, made a home out of everywhere I've been
Then you come crashing in, like the realest thing
Trying my best to understand all that your love can bring

[Chorus]
Oh half of my heart's got a grip on the situation
Half of my heart takes time
Half of my heart's got a right mind to tell you
That I can't keep loving you (can't keep loving you)
Oh, with half of my heart

I was made to believe I'd never love somebody else
I made a plan, stay the man who can only love himself
Lonely was the song I sang, 'till the day you came
Showing me a another way and all that my love can bring

[Chorus]

With half of my heart

Your faith is strong
But I can only fall short for so long
Down the road, later on
You will hate that I never gave more to you than half of my heart
But I can't stop loving you
(I can't stop loving you)
I can't stop loving you
(I can't stop loving you)
I can't stop loving you with half of my

Half of my heart
Oh, half of my heart
Half of my heart's got a real good imagination
Half of my heart's got you
Half of my heart's got a right mind to tell you
That half of my heart won't do

Half of my heart is a shotgun wedding 
To a bride with a paper ring
And half of my heart is the part of a man

You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier crazier

You make me crazier crazier crazier

I watched from a distance as you made life your own
Every sky was your own kind of blue
And I wanted to know how that would feel
And you made it so real
You showed me something that I couldn't see

How's life, tell me how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier then ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right
I go back to December all the time

These days I haven't been sleeping
Staying up playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I'd loved you in the fall
And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile, so good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again I swear I'd love you right

I'd go back in time and change it but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand

But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you

I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him

You smile and say, ""How are you?""
And I'll say, ""Just fine""

/lyric/27462109/Taylor+Swift/Better+Than+Revenge,Better Than Revenge,"Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did
Ha, time for a little revenge

The story starts when it was hot and it was summer
And, I had it all I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you could say sabotage
I never saw it coming, nor would I have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from

She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind,
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha

She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever present frown is a little troubling
And, she thinks I'm psycho
'Cause I like to rhyme her name with things, but
Sophistication isn't what you wear, or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
Oh they didn't teach you that in prep school
So it's up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
(Think about what you did)

She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind,
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha

I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at honey
You might have him, but haven't you heard
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at honey
You might have him, but I'll always get the last word
Whoa

She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find
Stealing other people's toys on the playground
Won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind,
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha

And do you still feel like you know what you're doing,
'Cause I don't think you do, oh
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing
I don't think you do, I don't think you do
Let's hear the applause
C'mon show me how much better you are

/lyric/27462107/Taylor+Swift/Last+Kiss,Last Kiss,"I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 1:58
The words that you whispered
For just us to know
You told me you loved me
So why did you go
Away
Away

I do recall now
The smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement
I ran off the plane
That July ninth
The beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt
I can still feel your arms

But now I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I don't know how to be something you missed
Never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

I do remember
The swing in your step
The life of the party, you're showing off again
And I roll my eyes and then
You pull me in
I'm not much for dancing
But for you I did

Because I love your handshake
Meetin' my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying something
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions

And I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is that
I don't know how to be something you miss
Never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
And I'll keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are

And I hope the sun shines
And it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you
You wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind

So I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is that
I don't know how to be something you miss
Never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

Just like our last kiss
Forever the name on my lips
Forever the name on my lips

From this part of the world, did you know that?

Well now he's back in the atmosphere
With drops of Jupiter in his hair, ay ay ay

He walks like summer and talks like rain
Reminds me that there's time to cha ay ange
Ay ay ange
But since his return from the stay on the moon
He listens like spring and he talks like June, ay ay 
Ay Ay 

But tell me did you sail across the sun
Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded
That heaven is overrated, tell me
Did you fall for a shooting star
One without a permanent scar and did you miss me while you were 
Looking for yourself out there 

Well now he's back from that soul vacation
Chasing his way through the constellation, ay ay ay

He checks out Mozart while he does tae-bo
Reminds me that there's room to grow, ay ay ay

Well now he's back in the atmosphere
I'm afraid that he might think of me as 
Plain ol' Jane told a story about a man 
Who is too afraid to fly so he never did land 

Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet
Did you finally get the chance to dance 
Along in the light of day yeah
Head back to the Milky Way
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind
Was it everything you wanted to find and did you miss me while you were 
Looking for yourself out there

Your best friend always sticking up for you
Even when I know you're wrong can you imagine

Just tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet
Did you finally get the chance to dance 
Along in the light of day yeah
Head back toward the Milky Way
And tell me, did you fall for a shooting star
One without a permanent scar and did you miss me while you were

'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listenin' to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do

But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers

That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see
You belong with me
You belong with me

Walkin' the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinkin' this is how it ought to be
Laughin' on a park bench, thinkin' to myself
""Hey, isn't this easy?""
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, what you doin' with a girl like that?

/lyric/27462103/Taylor+Swift/Dear+John,Dear John,"Long were the nights when my days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps,
Praying the floor won't fall through, again
My mother accused me of losing my mind,
But I swore I was fine, you paint me a blue sky
And go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game,
But you changed the rules every day
Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone
Tonight, well I stopped picking up, and this song is to let you know why

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress, cried the whole way home, I should've known

Well maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame
Maybe it's you and your sick need to give love then take it away
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors who don't understand
And I'll look back and regret how I ignored when they said ""run as fast as you can""

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress, cried the whole way home

Dear John, I see it all, now it was wrong
Don't you think nineteen is too young
To be played by your dark twisted games, when I loved you so?
I should've known

You are an expert at sorry,
And keeping the lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that you've run dry
Have tired, lifeless eyes
'Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches before fire could catch me,
So don't look now, I'm shining like fireworks over your sad, empty town

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress, cried the whole way home.

I see it all now that you're gone

/lyric/27462100/Taylor+Swift/Long+Live,Long Live,"I said remember this moment
In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered

I said remember this feeling
I passed the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, ""this is absurd""
'Cause for a moment a band of thieves in ripped up jeans got to rule the world

Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life
Fighting dragons with you
I was screaming, ""long live the look on your face""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered

Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall

Can you take a moment
Promise me this:
That you'll stand by me forever
But if God forbid fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children someday
When they point to the pictures
Please tell them my name
Tell them how the crowds went wild
Tell them how I hope they shine

Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life with you

Long, long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
And I was screaming, ""long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid

/lyric/24947281/Taylor+Swift/Fifteen,Fifteen,"You take a deep breath
And you walk through the doors
It's the morning of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in awhile
Try and stay out of everybody's way

It's your freshman year
And you're gonna be here for the next four years
In this town
Hoping one of those senior boys
Will wink at you and say, ""you know I haven't seen you around, before""

'Cause when you're fifteen,
Somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen

Feeling like there's nothing to figure out

Count to ten
Take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
At fifteen

You sit in class next to a red-head named Abigail
And soon enough you're best friends
Laughing at the other girls
Who they think they're so cool
We'll be out of here as soon as we can

And then you're on your very first date
And he's got a car
And you're feeling like flying
And you're mama's waiting up
And you're thinking he's the one
And you're dancing around the room when the night ends
When the night ends

'Cause when you're fifteen,
Somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen

And your first kiss makes your head spin around

But in your life you'll do things
Greater than dating the boy on the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen

When all you wanted
Was to be wanted
Wish you could go back
And tell yourself what you know now

Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had
To a boy who changed his mind
And we both cried

'Cause when you're fifteen,
Somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen

Don't forget to look before you fall

I've found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be
At fifteen

/lyric/35322571/Taylor+Swift/Innocent,Innocent,"I guess you really did it this time
Left yourself in your warpath
Lost your balance on a tightrope
Lost your mind tryin' to get it back

Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything?
And everybody believed in you?

It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent

Did some things you can't speak of
But at night you'll live it all again
You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
If only you had seen what you know now then

Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catchin' days?
And everything out of reach, someone bigger brought down to you
Wasn't it beautiful runnin' wild 'til you fell asleep?
Before the monsters caught up to you?

It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh, who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent

It's okay, life is a tough crowd
Thirty two is still growin' up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent

Time turns flames to embers
You'll have new Septembers
Every one of us has messed up too

Lives change like the weather
I hope you remember
Today is never too late to
Be brand new

/lyric/34088746/Taylor+Swift/If+This+Was+a+Movie,If This Was a Movie,"Last night I heard my own heart beating
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
Six months gone and I'm still reaching
Even though I know you're not there
I was playing back a thousand memories, baby
Thinking 'bout everything we've been through
Maybe I've been going back too much lately
When time stood still and I had you

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now

I know people change and these things happen
But I remember how it was back then
Locked up in your arms and our friends are laughing
'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them,
Now I'm pacing up the hall, chasing down your street
Flashback to a night when you said to me,
""Nothing's gonna change, not for me and you
Not before I knew how much I had to lose""

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now

If you're out there
If you're somewhere
If you're moving on
I'll be waiting for you
Wary, since you've been gone
I just want it back the way it was before
And I just want to see you back at my front door
And I say

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would before you say it's not that easy
Before the fight, before I locked you out
But I take it all back now
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you'd be here by now

/lyric/22349571/Taylor+Swift/Back+to+December+%5BAcoustic+Version%5D,Back to December [Acoustic Version],"I'm so glad you made time to see me.
How's life, tell me how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while.
You've been good, busier then ever.
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why.

Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind.
You gave me roses and I left them there to die.

So this is me swallowing my pride,
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night,
And I go back to December all the time.
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you,
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine.
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it all right.
I go back to December all the time.

These days I haven't been sleeping
Staying up playing back myself leaving,
When your birthday passed and I didn't call.
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall.
And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind.
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye.

So this is me swallowing my pride,
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night.
And I go back to December all the time.
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you,
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine.
I'd go back to December turn around and change my own mind.
I go back to December all the time

I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile, so good to me, so right,
And how you held me in your arms that September night,
The first time you ever saw me cry.
Maybe this is wishful thinking,
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again I swear I'd love you right.

I'd go back in time and change it but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand.

But this is me swallowing my pride,
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night,
And I go back to December.
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you,
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine.
I'd go back to December turn around and make it all right.
I'd go back to December turn around and change my own mind.

And every time you shine, I'll shine for you

Honey, I like the way you're everything I've ever wanted

/lyric/22100596/Taylor+Swift/Half+of+My+Heart,Half of My Heart,"I was born in the arms of imaginary friends
Free to roam, made a home out of everywhere I've been
Then you come crashing in, like the realest thing
Trying my best to understand all that your love can bring

Oh half of my heart's got a grip on the situation
Half of my heart takes time
Half of my heart's got a right mind to tell you
That I can't keep loving you (can't keep loving you)
Oh, with half of my heart

I was made to believe I'd never love somebody else
I made a plan, stay the man who can only love himself
Lonely was the song I sang, 'till the day you came
Showing me a another way and all that my love can bring

Oh half of my heart's got a grip on the situation
Half of my heart takes time
Half of my heart's got a right mind to tell you
That I can't keep loving you (can't keep loving you)
Oh, with half of my heart

With half of my heart

Your faith is strong
But I can only fall short for so long
Down the road, later on
You will hate that I never gave more to you than half of my heart
But I can't stop loving you
(I can't stop loving you)
I can't stop loving you
(I can't stop loving you)
I can't stop loving you with half of my

Half of my heart
Oh, half of my heart
Half of my heart's got a real good imagination
Half of my heart's got you
Half of my heart's got a right mind to tell you
That half of my heart won't do

Half of my heart is a shotgun wedding
To a bride with a paper ring
And half of my heart is the part of a man

It's getting cold
I've got my big coat on

I hear your laugh
And look up smiling at you
I run and run
Past the pumpkin patch
And the tractor rides
Look now, the sky is gold
I hug your legs
And fall asleep on the way home

I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
But I know you're not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day with you today

I'm thirteen now
And don't know how
My friends could be so mean
I come home crying
And you hold me tight
And grab the keys

And we drive and drive
Until we find a town far enough away
And we talk and window shop
'Till I forgotten all their names

I don't know who I'm gonna talk to now at school
But I know I'm laughing
On the car ride home with you
Don't know how long it's gonna take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day with you today

I have an excellent father
His strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother
Inside and out he's better than I am
I grew up in a pretty house
And I've got space to run and hide
And I had the best days with you

There is a video I found
From back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen
And you're talking to me
It's the age of princesses and pirate ships
And the seven dwarfs
And Daddy's smart
And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world

And now I know why the all the trees change in the fall
I know you were on my side
Even when I was wrong
And I love you for giving me your eyes
Staying back and watching me shine

And, I didn't know if you knew
So I'm taking this chance to say
That I had the best day with you today.",Taylor_Swift,get get hear look smile run run past ride look hug fall know change know know know know could mean come hold grab drive drive find talk forget know go talk know laugh ride know go take feel know make smile grow get run hide find set talk know change know love give stay watch shine know know take say,year coat laugh pumpkin patch tractor sky gold leg way tree fall house day today friend crying key town window shop name school car day today father strength brother house space day video paint set kitchen age princess pirate ship dwarfs lady world tree fall side eye chance day today,now home why at all far away now how so home far enough away now home how long out back when now why even when back so,year old get cold get big coat hear laugh look smile run run past pumpkin patch tractor ride look sky gold hug leg fall asleep way home know tree change fall know scared know Snow White house near far away know good day today thirteen know friend mean come home crying hold tight grab key drive drive find town far away talk window shop till forget name know go to talk school know laugh car ride home know long go to feel okay know good day today excellent father strength make strong God smile little brother inside well grow pretty house get space run hide good day video find set paint set kitchen talk age princess pirate ship seven dwarfs Daddy smart pretty lady wide world know tree change fall know wrong love give eye stay watch shine know know take chance good day today

Don't know why I do

Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be

Give him all her love

And know she's lucky 'cause

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star

Don't know why I do

So I drive home alone
As I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down
And maybe get some sleep tonight

/lyric/31771366/Taylor+Swift/Tim+McGraw,Tim McGraw,"He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said: ""That's a lie.""
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On back roads at night
And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer had gone

[Chorus]
But when you think ""Tim McGraw""
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think ""that little black dress""
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back
It's hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe

[Chorus]

And I'm back for the first time since then
I'm standin' on your street
And there's a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that you'll read

Is when you think ""Tim McGraw""
I hope you think my favorite song
Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place
When you think happiness
I hope you think ""that little black dress""
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw

And all my single friends are jealous.
He says everything I need to hear
And it's like I couldn't ask for anything better.
He opens up my door and
I get into his car and he says
You look beautiful tonight.
And I feel perfectly fine.

But I miss screamin' and fightin' and kissin' in the rain
And its 2am and I'm cursin' your name.
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you.
Breakin' down and comin' undone
It's a roller coaster kinda rush.
And I never knew I could feel that much.
And that's the way I loved you.

He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will.
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father.
He's charming and endearing
And I'm comfortable.

But I miss screamin' and fightin' and kissin' in the rain
And it's 2am and I'm cursin' your name.
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you.

And I never knew I could feel that much.
And that's the way I loved you.

He can't see the smile I'm fakin'.
And my hearts not breakin'
Cause I'm not feelin' anything at all.
And you were wild and crazy.
Just so frustrating, intoxicating, complicated,
Got away like some mistake.

And now I,

It was a moment of weakness and you said yes

You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice before you let it all go
You should've know that word, bout what you did with her
Would get back to me
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby and you might still have me

You can see that I've been crying
And baby you know all the right things: to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same
You say that the past is the past, you need one chance

My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be

In a field behind your yard
You and I are painting pictures in the sky
Sometimes we don't say a thing
Just listen to the crickets sing
Everything I need is right here by my side

And I know everything about you
I don't wanna live without you

I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only trying
To let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you

Just a small-town boy and girl
Living in the crazy world
Trying to figure out what is and isn't true
And I don't try to hide my tears
My secrets or my deepest fears
Through it all nobody gets me like you do

And you know everything about me
You say that you can't live without me

I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only trying
To let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you

When I'm with anybody else

Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said: ""That's a lie.""
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On back roads at night
And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer had gone

But when you think ""Tim McGraw""
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think ""that little black dress""
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back
It's hard not to find it all a little bitter sweet
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe

But when you think ""Tim McGraw""
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think ""that little black dress""
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

And I'm back for the first time since then
I'm standin' on your street
And there's a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that you'll read

Is when you think ""Tim McGraw""
I hope you think my favorite song
Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place
When you think happiness
I hope you think ""that little black dress""
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw

Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
You know it's all the same, another time and place
Repeating history and you're getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do
And I'll do anything to see it through

Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?

It's a revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah

So we've been outnumbered
Raided and now cornered
It's hard to fight when the fight ain't fair
We're getting stronger now
Find things they never found
They might be bigger
But we're faster and never scared
You can walk away, say we don't need this
But there's something in your eyes
Says we can beat this

Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
It's a revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah

Fight for what we've worked for all these years
And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives

I've seen it all, so I thought
But I've never seen nobody shine the way you do
The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change
Hey Stephen, why are people always leaving
I think you and I should stay the same

Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm I can't help myself

They're dimming the street lights, you're perfect for me
Why aren't you here tonight?
I'm waiting alone now so come on and come out
And pull me near and shine, shine, shine

Hey Stephen, I could give you fifty reasons
Why I should be the one you choose
All those other girls, well they're beautiful
But would they write a song for you?

Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else

I can't help myself if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so

Ignoring words that you were saying
Trying to make me stay
I said, this time I've had enough
And you've called a hundred times
But I'm not picking up
'Cause I'm so mad I might tell you that it's over
But if you look a little closer

I said leave but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, ""I'm in love with you""
Wait there in the pouring rain, coming back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

Me and my stupid pride, sitting here alone
Going through the photographs
Staring at the phone
I keep going back over, things we both said
And I remember the slamming door
And all the things that I misread
So babe if you know everything
Tell me why you couldn't see
That when I left I wanted you to chase after me

I said leave but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, ""I'm in love with you""
Wait there in the pouring rain, coming back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

And I'll scream out the window
I can't even look at you
I don't need you but I do, I do, I do
I say, there's nothing you can say
To make this right again
I mean it, I mean it, what I mean is

I said leave but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, ""I'm in love with you""
Wait there in the pouring rain, coming back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

With your face and the beautiful eyes
And the conversation with the little white lies

I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, I run and run
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides, look now, the sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home

I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
But I know you're not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day with you today

I'm thirteen now and don't know how my friends could be so mean
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names

I don't know who I'm gonna talk to now at school
But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you
Don't know how long it's gonna take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day with you today

I have an excellent father, his strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother, inside and out, he's better than I am
I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run
And I had the best days with you

There is a video I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me
It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs
And Daddy's smart and you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world

And now I know why the all the trees change in the fall
I know you were on my side even when I was wrong
And I love you for giving me your eyes
For staying back and watching me shine

That I want and I'm needing everything that we should be

And she's got everything that I have to live without

Drew talks to me, I laugh 'cause it is just so funny
That I can't even see anyone when he's with me
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

Drew walks by me, can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be
She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky cause

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

So I drive home alone, as I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down and maybe
Get some sleep tonight

Because he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

See you make your way through the crowd

Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, please, don't go

Said you'd beat me up; you were bigger than me
You never did, you never did
Take me back when our world was one block wide
I dared you to kiss me, and ran when you tried

And said, ""Oh, my, my, my""

Take me back to the creek beds we turned up
Two AM, ridin' in your truck
And all I need is you next to me
Take me back to the time we had our very first fight
Slammin' of doors 'stead of kissin' goodnight
You stayed outside till the morning light
Oh, my, my, my, my

A few years had gone and come around
We were sittin' at our favorite spot in town
And you looked at me, got down on one knee

Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
Our whole town came, and our mamas cried
You said, ""I do,"" and I did too
Take me home where we met so many years before
We'll rock our babies on the very front porch
After all this time, you and I

And I'll be eighty-seven, you'll be eighty-nine

/lyric/12218149/Taylor+Swift/Our+Song+%5BRadio+Edit%5D,Our Song [Radio Edit],"I was riding shotgun with my hair undone in the front seat of his car,
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel,
The other on my heart,
I look around, turn the radio down, he says, ""baby is something wrong?""
I say ""nothing, I was just thinking how we don't have a song,"" 
And he says,

Our song is a slamming screen door, 
Sneaking out late tapping on your window,
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow,
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know,
Our song is the way you laugh,
The first date man I didn't kiss her when I should have,
And when I got home, before I said amen,
Asking God if He could play it again.

I was walking up the front porch steps after everything that day,
Had gone all wrong, had been trampled on and lost and thrown away,
Got to the hallway well on my way to my lovin' bed,
I almost didn't notice all the roses,
And the note that said,

Our song is a slamming screen door, 
Sneaking out late tapping on your window,
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow,
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know,
Our song is the way you laugh,
The first date man I didn't kiss her when I should have,
And when I got home, before I said amen,
Asking God if He could play it again.

I've heard every album, listened to the radio,
Waiting for something to come along,
That was as good as our song,

'Cause our song is a slamming screen door,
Sneaking out late tapping on your window,
When we're on the phone, and he talks real slow,
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know,
Our song is the way he laughs,
The first date man I didn't kiss him when I should have,
And when I got home, before I said amen,
Asking God if He could play it again.

And you just see right through me but if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful, miracle, unbelievable

And now you've come undone and I, I, I, I

Seen you fall, seen you crawl on your knees, eh eh
Seen you lost in a crowd, seen your colors fade
Wish I could make it better
Someday you won't remember
This pain you thought would last forever and ever

And there you'll stand, ten feet tall
I will say, I knew it all along
Your eyes' wider than distance
This life's sweeter than fiction

Just a shot, just a shot in the dark, oh oh
All you got, all you got are your shattered hopes
They never saw it coming
You hit the ground running
And now you're onto something, I, I, I say

What a sight, what a sight when the light came on
Proved me right, proved me right when you proved them wrong
And in this perfect weather
It's like we don't remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever

And there you'll stand, ten feet tall

Look at you now, look at you now, now
I'll be one of the many saying,

And when they call your name
And they put your picture in a frame
You know that I'll be there time and again
'Cause I loved you when, when you

Hood over your head
Keep your eyes down
Tell your friends you're out for a run
You'll be flushed when you return
Take the road less traveled by
Tell yourself you can always stop
What started in beautiful rooms
Ends with meetings in parking lots

And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings
And longing stares
It's born from just one single glance
But it dies, and it dies, and it dies
A million little times

Leave the perfume on the shelf
That you picked out just for him
So you leave no trace behind
Like you don't even exist
Take the words for what they are
A dwindling, mercurial high
A drug that only worked
The first few hundred times

And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings
And stolen stares
They show their truth one single time
But they lie, and they lie, and they lie
A billion little times

And you wanna scream
Don't call me kid
Don't call me baby
Look at this godforsaken mess that you made me
You showed me colors you know 
I can't see with anyone else

Don't call me kid

In the trees
I hit my peak at seven feet
In the swing
Over the creek
I was too scared to jump in
But I, I was high in the sky
With Pennsylvania under me
Are there still beautiful things?

Sweet tea in the summer
Cross your heart, won't tell no other
And though I can't recall your face
I still got love for you
Your braids like a pattern
Love you to the moon and to Saturn
Passed down like folk songs
The love lasts so long

And I've been meaning to tell you
I think your house is haunted
Your dad is always mad and that must be why
And I think you should come live with
Me and we can be pirates
Then you won't have to cry
Or hide in the closet
And just like a folk song
Our love will be passed on

Please picture me
In the weeds
Before I learned civility
I used to scream ferociously
Any time I wanted
I, I

I used to think I would meet somebody there
Teal was the color of your shirt 
When you were sixteen at the yogurt shop
You used to work at to make a little money

Gave me no compasses, gave me no signs
Were there clues I didn't see?
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?

Bad was the blood of the song in the cab 
On your first trip to LA
You ate at my favorite spot for dinner
Bold was the waitress on our three year trip 
Getting lunch down by the lakes
She said I looked like an American singer

Time, mystical time
Cuttin' me open, then healin' me fine
Were there clues I didn't see?
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh

A string that pulled me
Out of all the wrong arms right into that dive bar
Something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire
Chains around my demons, wool to brave the seasons
One single thread of gold tied me to you

Cold was the steel of my axe to grind 
For the boys who broke my heart
Now I send their babies presents
Gold was the color of the leaves 
When I showed you around Centennial Park
Hell was the journey but it brought me heaven

Time, wondrous time
Gave me the blues and then purple pink skies
And it's cool, baby, with me

So I got wasted like all my potential
And my words shoot to kill when I'm mad

Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here

On the one screen in my town

I never needed anything more
Whispers
Of ""Are you sure?""
""Never have I ever before""

But I can see us
Lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away
Like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

Your back
Beneath the sun
Wishing I could write my name on it
Will you call when you're back at school?
I remember thinking I had you

'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets

Back when we were still changing for the better
Wanting was enough
For me, it was enough
To live for the hope of it all
Cancel plans just in case you'd call
And say ""Meet me behind the mall""
So much for summer love, and saying ""Us""

You weren't mine to lose

Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

But I knew you
Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight
I, I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, right

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan 
Under someone's bed

Chase two girls, lose the one

Givin' me your weekends
I, I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line
Once in twenty lifetimes, I

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now I'm bleedin'

'Cause I knew you
Steppin' on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain
I, I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy
I, I knew you
Leavin' like a father
Runnin' like water, I
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing

But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasing shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back

About why you switched your homeroom
But I think it's 'cause of me
Betty, one time I was riding on my skateboard 
When I passed your house
It's like I couldn't breathe
You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me?
Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go f*ck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen
I don't know anything but I know I miss you

Betty, I know where it all went wrong
Your favorite song was playing 
From the far side of the gym
I was nowhere to be found
I hate the crowds, you know that
Plus, I saw you dance with him
You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me?
Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go f*ck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen
I don't know anything but I know I miss you

I was walking home on broken cobblestones
Just thinking of you when she pulled up
Like a figment of my worst intentions
She said ""James, get in, let's drive""
Those days turned into nights
Slept next to her but
I dreamt of you all summer long

Betty, I'm here on your doorstep
And I planned it out for weeks now but
It's finally sinking in
Betty, right now is the last time
I can dream about what happens when you see my face again
The only thing I wanna do
Is make it up to you

So, I showed up at your party
Yeah, I showed up at your party
Yeah, I showed up at your party
Will you have me?
Will you love me?
Will you kiss me on the porch 
In front of all your stupid friends?
If you kiss me
Will it be just like I dreamed it? 
Will it patch your broken wings?

Her saltbox house on the coast took her mind off St. Louis
Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name, and money
And the town said ""How did a middle class divorcée do it?""

The wedding was charming, if a little gauche
There's only so far new money goes
They picked out a home and called it ""Holiday House""
Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud
The doctor had told him to settle down
It must have been her fault his heart gave out

And they said ""There goes the last great American dynasty""
Who knows, if she never showed up what could've been
There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything

Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever
Flew in all the Bitch Pack friends from the city
Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names
And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet
And losing on card game bets with Dalí

And they said ""There goes the last great American dynasty""
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
There goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything

They say she was seen on occasion
Pacing the rocks staring out at the midnight sea
And in a feud with her neighbor
She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green
Fifty years is a long time
Holiday House sat quietly on that beach
Free of women with madness
Their men and bad habits, and then it was bought by me

Who knows, if I never showed up what could've been

Stress, and holiday shopping traffic
But I close my eyes, and I'm somewhere else
Just like magic

In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
Where the people would come
To dance under sparkling lights
Bundled up in their mittens and coats
And the cider would flow
And I just wanna be there tonight

Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everything is icy and blue
And you would be there too

Under the mistletoe
Watching the fire glow
And telling me, ""I love you""
Just being in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true

In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
There's a light in the barn
We'd run inside out from the cold
In the town, kids are dreaming of sleighs
And they're warm and they're safe
They wake to see a blanket of snow

Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everything is icy and blue
And you would be there too

Born into nothing

Something to cling to
Visions of dazzling rooms I'll never get let into

And the memories were lost long ago
But at least you have beautiful ghosts

A flicker of light before the dawning
Out here, the wild ones are taming the fear within me
Scared to call them my friends and be broken again
Is this hope just a mystical dream?

And so maybe my home isn't what I had known
What I thought it would be

And I know that this life isn't safe but it's wild and it's free

And I'm just like, ""Hey, are you okay?""

And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression
But I've learned a lesson that stressin' and obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun
And snakes and stones never broke my bones

So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down
You're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to just stop
Like can you just not step on my gown?
You need to calm down

You are somebody that we don't know
But you're comin' at my friends like a missile
Why are you mad?
When you could be GLAAD? (You could be GLAAD)
Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark age
Just makin' that sign must've taken all night

You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace
And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate
'Cause shade never made anybody less gay

So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down
You're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (oh)
You need to just stop
Like can you just not step on his gown?
You need to calm down

And we see you over there on the internet
Comparing all the girls who are killing it
But we figured you out
We all know now we all got crowns
You need to calm down

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down
You're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (oh)
You need to just stop (can you stop?)
Like can you just not step on our gowns?

/lyric/36814636/Taylor+Swift/Only+The+Young,Only The Young,"It keeps me awake
The look on your face
The moment you heard the news
You're screaming inside
And frozen in time
You did all that you could do
The game was rigged, the ref got tricked
The wrong ones think they're right
You were outnumbered, this time

But only the young
Only the young
Only the young
Only the young can run
Can run, so run
And run, and run

So every day now
You brace for the sound
You've only heard on TV
You go to class, scared
Wondering where the best hiding spot would be
And the big bad man and his big bad clan
Their hands are stained with red
Oh, how quickly, they forget

They aren't gonna help us
Too busy helping themselves
They aren't gonna change this
We gotta do it ourselves
They think that it's over
But it's just begun

Only one thing can save us
Only the young (only the young)
Only the young (only the young)
Only the young (only the young)
Only the young

Only the young (only the young)
Only the young (only the young)
Only the young (only the young)
Only the young
Only the young (only the young)
(Don't say you're too tired to fight
It's just a matter of time
Up there's the finish line)
Only the young
Can run

Don't say you're too tired to fight
It's just a matter of time (can run)
Up there's the finish line
So run, and run, and run
Don't say you're too tired to fight
It's just a matter of time (so run)
Up there's the finish line
And run, and run, and run

Only the young
Only the young
