When you're drunk with your friends at a party?
What's your favorite song, does it make you smile?
Do you think of me?

When you close your eyes, tell me, what are you dreamin'?
Everything, I wanna know it all

I'd spend ten thousand hours and ten thousand more
Oh, if that's what it takes to learn that sweet heart of yours
And I might never get there, but I'm gonna try
If it's ten thousand hours or the rest of my life
I'm gonna love you (ooh, ooh ooh, ooh, ooh)

Do you miss the road that you grew up on?
Did you get your middle name from your grandma?
When you think about your forever now, do you think of me?

When you close your eyes, tell me, what are you dreamin'?
Everything, I wanna know it all

I'd spend ten thousand hours and ten thousand more
Oh, if that's what it takes to learn that sweet heart of yours
And I might never get there, but I'm gonna try
If it's ten thousand hours or the rest of my life

I'm gonna love you (ooh, ooh ooh, ooh, ooh)
I'm gonna love you (ooh, ooh ooh, ooh, ooh)

Ooh, want the good and the bad and everything in between
Ooh, gotta cure my curiosity
Ooh, yeah

I'd spend ten thousand hours and ten thousand more
Oh, if that's what it takes to learn that sweet heart of yours (sweet heart of yours)
And I might never get there, but I'm gonna try

Oh, ah

White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say ""thank you"" or ""please""
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul so cynical

So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
Duh

I'm the bad guy

Gold teeth, my neck, my wrist is froze (so icy)
I got more ice than, than the snow
That guy, don't act like you don't know
That guy, so critical (skrrt)
Tattoos on both my sleeves
Yeah, I don't sleep, please don't wake me
Loosen my tie up so I can breathe
It ain't political, oh no (uh-uh)

Yeah, I'm a bad guy
Ain't no holdin' back guy
Come off like I'm mad guy
Always got your back guy
Yeah, I'm the real type
Keep you for the thrills type
Show you what it feels like
Got an open invite
I'm the bad guy, whoa-ooh (duh)

I'm the bad guy
Duh
I'm only good at bein' bad, bad

(Ahh)
(Ah)
I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone (so icy)
You said she's scared of me?
I mean, I don't see what she sees

All I care about is money and the city that I'm from
I'mma sing until I feel it, I'mma go until it's done
I don't need to say wassup and my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only getting older, somebody shoulda told you
I'm on one
You know I'm on one, yeah
I said I'm on one
You know, I'm on one

One drink and let's all get faded, yeah

Drizzy Drake, check me out
Coming live from the motherfucking North Side
Kick game, run game, run it real good
But never ever have my bitches sitting court side
Same nigga that you knew way back when
You acting like it's somebody you don't know
Tell me, how the f*ck we supposed to stay friends
When you got a bunch of feelings that you don't show?
I could tell, I could tell
I could tell certain people don't like me no more
New shit don't excite me no more
Guess that they don't really make 'em like me no more
You can look me in my eyes and see I ain't myself
'Cause if y'all what I created then I hate myself
But still, let them girls in
And tell them all leave their cell phones
On the table where we see them
I'm all day with it man, A.M to the P.M
Niggas hating, I just wish that they would say it when they see him

That's that ish that drives me crazy
And that's all I've been getting lately
And it's probably why I'm scared to put the time in
Women want to f*ck like they're me and I'm them
Looking for some things and I think that I can find them in you

Oh woah, trust issues, oh woah, trust issues
Oh woah, trust issues, oh woah

Daydreamin' 'bout us fuckin' in your living room (Uh)
Doin' push ups 'cause I know you 'bout to visit soon (Grr)

And I don't ever wear a suit and tie
Wonderin' if I could sneak out the back
Nobody's even lookin' me in my eyes
Then you take my hand
Finish my drink, say, ""Shall we dance?"" Hell, yeah
You know I love you, did I ever tell you?
You make it better like that

Don't think I fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say, yeah
I always feel like I'm nobody, mm
Who wants to fit in anyway?

'Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah

And you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah

You can take me anywhere

We at a party we don't wanna be at
Tryna talk, but we can't hear ourselves
Read your lips, I'd rather kiss 'em right back
With all these people all around
I'm crippled with anxiety
But I'm told it's where I'm supposed to be
You know what? It's kinda crazy 'cause I really don't mind
And you make it better like that

Don't think we fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say, oh yeah, yeah
When we walked in, I said I'm sorry, mm
But now I think that we should stay

Life of the party, pourin' shots of the brown
And you see me from the street but I don't turn around
Would you say, ""Hi""? Would you keep going?

If I told your family that you didn't mean nothing
If you posted about it and I didn't even comment
If the songs weren't true, but you still feel something
Would you still come looking for me?

Oh, don't go reaching out
'Cause you can't have everything
Your head and your heart won't feel the same
Even if it feels like it every time

Don't check on me
If we're not together, then it's probably for a reason
Every heartbreak has its season
It ain't always summer in June

Might run across your mind but don't worry 'bout me, no
My heart is back in one piece, it ain't skipped a beat, no
Feeling rested up, I ain't missing sleep, no oh
Don't take it personal if I can't reply now
I'm distant 'cause I don't wanna be reached now
Won't let the ghosts of our past weigh my future down
I'm liberated
Energy's like a circle, it comes back around
Reciprocated
Don't shed no more tears
Won't gain no empathy from me
In the upcoming years
Oh, I don't need your pity
Don't check on me

Oh, don't check on me
If we're not together, then it's probably for a reason
Every heartbreak has its season
And it looks like winter for you

Ain't call you back 'cause I let it go
I had to focus energy and just let it flow
And when we ride low, we're already gone
It wouldn't mean anymore to me now
I know it hurts you so bad just to see me happy
That I finally moved on, and you thought it wouldn't happen
At times I used to cry, wouldn't know when I was laughing
But I act like I didn't notice

Oh, don't go reaching out
'Cause you can't have everything
You can't kill a flame with gasoline
Even if it feels like it every time (No matter how hard you try)

Don't check on me
If we're not together, then it's probably for a reason
Every heartbreak has its season
It ain't always summer in June
Don't check on me
If we're not together, then it's probably for a reason

You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?
'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
And by once or twice I mean maybe a couple of hundred times
So let me, oh, let me redeem, oh, redeem, oh, myself tonight

You fit me, tailor-made love, how you put it on 
Got the only key, know how to turn it on 
The way you nibble on my ear, the only words I wanna hear

Quiero ver bailar tu pelo 
Quiero ser tu ritmo 
Que le enseñes a mi boca

Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro 
Hasta provocar tus gritos 
Y que olvides tu apellido 

Si te pido un beso, ven, dámelo

Sabes que tu corazón conmigo te hace bom, bom 
Sabes que esa beba está buscando de mi bom, bom 
Ven, prueba de mi boca para ver cómo te sabe 
Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuánto amor a ti te cabe 
Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje 
Empecemos lento, después salvaje 

Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito 
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito 
Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza 
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza 
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito 
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito 
Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas 
Pero pa' montarlo aquí tengo la pieza

This is how we do it down in Puerto Rico 
I just wanna hear you screaming, ""¡Ay, Bendito!"" 
I can move forever cuando esté contigo

I will still be patient with you

I won't let go
I'll be your lifeline tonight

It's how we learn and how we grow

Even though you might get mad at me, oh, oh
Sometimes it's hard to face reality

Should've been adjusted to my life
Had the opportunity to stay and wait for the last time
Now you're standin' right in front of me
It hurts me to know that I lied
Try to protect your feelings
You read in between the lines
Hope your heart has started healing

Sometimes it's hard to face reality, oh, oh
Even though you might get mad at me, oh, oh
Sometimes it's hard to face reality

Don't be afraid to stand alone
Don't be afraid to stand outside your comfort zone
I know it's hard away from home
And it ain't easy all alone
Relationships over the phone
Talkin' to your significant other all night long

Sometimes it's hard to face reality, oh, oh
Even though you might get mad at me, oh, oh
Sometimes it's hard to face reality
Sometimes it's hard to face reality

Love and death are quite similar
How they come and go like cat burglars
Reality is kind of hard to face
Like actual facts and flat-earthers
Rain's a requirement for flowers to grow
And pain's a requirement for power to grow
It's a miracle how one could change from one what was just hours ago
Such is life though, it's just a cycle
The bigger picture and the smaller picture
Are exactly same, it's macro, micro
Crack your ad and let your light glow
One day you can be the king of pop
And the next one just be wack ol' Michael
It's human nature, just like he told us
Let's face reality, crack the cycle

Know it hurts to see the truth in your face
Circumstances bring you down to your knees
Go on and cry an ocean, but don't drown in it
Enough to put your heart at ease
Ooh, don't lose your self esteem
I apologise, for being a man
It's way harder than what it seems

Sometimes it's hard to face reality, oh, oh (reality)
Even though you might get mad at me, oh, oh (you might get mad at me, but I'll be at your bedside)

I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas day

I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow
I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe

I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click

'Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do
'Cause baby all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

All the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children
Laughter fills the air

And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need
Won't you please bring my baby to me

I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just want to see my baby
Standing right outside my door

Oh I just want him for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
Baby all I want for Christmas
Is you, baby

It's all I want for Christmas

You said I'm steady playin', but you steady playin' too
Your big brother foot work
Your play sister Juke
The rink was the place but in that space and time I was too young for you
As you were for me, to worry about Frooties and Chews
'Til I found out all the shawdy's with cooties was cute
And realized what booties can do

We gon' get it poppin'
We gon' get it Jukin'
We gon' throw a party
We ain't gotta do shit
You came with your best friend
Came up with for the weekend
Rolling with your parties
So tell me what you thinkin'
So we gon' have a juke jam
We gon' have a juke jam
We can have a party, just listening to music
Like we used to do
I'll get close to you
I remember you
You used to ""I remember you"" 'cause

We've got so much history baby, maybe
Maybe you and I were meant to be
Maybe I'm crazy

We never rolled at the rink
We would just go to the rink
You ain't buy tokens no more
You just hit roll at the rink
You had a nigga, I couldn't stand him
But when they play ""Take You Down"", Chris Brown
I am him standing
I mean it's just dancing
It's harmless as f*ck
Then I put my waist through your hips
And your legs and your arms just to harness you up
Then we hit the floor
All the kitties start skating
To see grown folks do, what grown folks do
When they grown and they dating

We've got so much history baby, maybe
Maybe you and I were meant to be
Maybe I'm crazy
Crazy about you

We gon' get it poppin'
We gon' get it Jukin'
We gon' throw a party

Only to lose yourself

You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Right now, don't rush, no pressure
You ain't gotta make your mind up

Never thought I'd take you serious
Now I need you, not a moment later
Losin' it, I'm so delirious
And I'ma put up a fight for it
Never give up a love like this
Finally I found someone
That can do me like no other
Talking to my conscience
I made a few mistakes
I did it to myself
I'm the only one to blame

Girl I need your attention
And every time I see you make that face
I wanna love you all over the place
Don't do it, baby
Don't do it to me, no

I know you don't wanna talk, right
We've been on and off like the crosslights
You heard I'm playin' with them hoes like I golf, right?
When I touch you, I get frostbite
Girl you're so cold, so cold, so cold
How we so young but livin' so old?
In the bed together but we sleepin' solo
That could drive you loco
You're supposed to be my uno, Yoko Ono
Oh no, round two again
We've been fighting more than Ryu and Ken
Last time we argued eight straight days
I learned my lesson, I got straight As
And I know it's deeper than masseuses
Oh, you know I eat the cookie like I'm Lucious
Go ahead and take the time
But it's a waste of time if your waist ain't on mine

How am I supposed to take that?
Boo'd up, missing all of that
Gotta be laying in that

Try to figure out which way to go
It's like you're stuck on a treadmill
Running in the same place
You got your hazard lights on now
Hoping that somebody would slow down
Praying for a miracle
Who'll show you grace?
Had a couple dollars and a quarter tank of gas
With a long journey ahead
Seen a truck pull over
God sent an angel to help you out
He gave you direction
Showed you how to read a map
With a long journey ahead
Said it ain't over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt

Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again

Relationship on a ski slope
Avalanche comin' down slow
Do we have enough time to salvage this love?
Feels like a blizzard in April
'Cause my heart is just that cold
Skating on thin ice
But it's strong enough to hold us up
Seen her scream and holler
Put us both on blast
Tearing each other down
When I thought it was over
God sent us an angel to help us out
He gave us direction, showed us how to make it last
For that long journey ahead
Said it ain't ever over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt

Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again
Life is worth living again

What I get from my reflection
Is a different perception
From what the world may see
They try to crucify me
I ain't perfect, won't deny
My reputation's on the line
So I'm working on a better me

Let's take a shot together and then lay up like planks
Never ever, do I wanna leave my little lady
Patrón down, back down, they got a plan 'fore that boy wake
Told God if I get a iced out watch I won't be late (I promise)
Every time I try to stick it in all the way

I gave you food and I gave you clothes
I taught you how to move your feet when the rhythms on
Still you wanna leave 'cause you feel alone

You don't know what they're like
If they know that you're alive
They're gonna try to take away the secrets of your planet's life
I know you must be upset, you lost your family in a wreck
But you gotta listen (listen, listen)

Don't try to find your spaceship
It might be out there waiting
Stay in my backpack forever
Stay in my backpack forever
(You know I gotta find my spaceship,
My planet's outside there waiting,
I can't stay in your backpack forever)
Stay in your backpack, backpack, backpack

Before you came around I was in a rut
Didn't have a friend, didn't know what it was
You taught how to dream and how to love
You're my best friend please listen to me

You don't know what they're like
If they know that you're alive
They're gonna try to take away the secrets of your planet's life
I know you must be upset, you lost your family in a wreck

Greetings, I fell from the sky
I'm from a different world I use Lil Wayne as a disguise
And my flying saucer crashed, I'm the only one that survived
I'm only taking over this planet since I arrived
I'm in a backpack, I'm ducking Men in Black
Yeah, I'm an alien, my swag is outta this world
Different galaxy, they try to capture me
When I die they gonna name this planet after me
Wayne's world (Wayne's world, Wayne's world)

Don't try to find your spaceship
It might be out there waiting
Stay in my backpack forever

(You know I gotta find my spaceship,
My planet's outside there waiting,
I can't stay in your backpack forever)

Hit me on my line if you're tryna come through

I feel my heartbeat bumpin' to the bass
Bum bum bum bum
She give me butterflies and they won't go away
Oh wey oh wey
Under the stars, she took my hand and said
""Love, you, need you, need you here to stay""

I hit it twice, it's a habit
Don't get caught up in traffic
I heard that it's hazardous
There's storm and no silence to add on the mattress
I just keep askin, is it real, is it real? Look, tell me, is it real?
Yep, real enough to go and get it tatted, give you flowers
Now you look like you're on a pageant
I can take you to the crib, condo, or the cabin, what's up?
If you make it, I can make it happen, I can grant it
Don't you take my ""grant it"" though for granted
I know that's not your intent, we ain't even campin' and to leave this
Bed I'mma need a fuckin' ransom man I got her screamin'
""Finally Famous!"" when we fly around
Never lie to you 'less I lie you down
I put the writin' on the wall
But you don't understand it all like we in Chinatown

To the city from my mom house, now I ball with my tongue out
Pull out my chain and think that the sun out

I hope you believe in us

You don't see, 'cause what you don't see, is when we don't speak
I really don't sleep, I wanna talk to ya
And if I had the world in my hands, I'd give it all to ya
I wanna know if you feelin' the way that I'm feelin'

Be right there (be right there)
I ain't never going nowhere
I'm just tryna see where this can take us
'Cause everything about you girl is so contagious
I think I finally got it down
And all that's left to do now is get at the mirror
And say it to her, yeah

Could it be a possibility? I'm tryna see what's up
It's been me for you, and you for me, maybe now is time for us
Tryna keep it all together, but enough is enough
They say we're too young for love, but I'm
Catching feelings
Catching feelings girl

Should I tell her how I really feel? (How I really feel?)
Or should I move in close or just be still? (How will I know?)
'Cause if I take a chance, and I touch her hand, will everything change?
How do I know, if she feels the same, woah

Could it be a possibility? I'm tryna see what's up
It's been me for you, and you for me, maybe now is time for us
Tryna keep it all together, but enough is enough

Its in the papers, its on the TV,
Its everywhere that I go
Children are crying
Soldiers are dying
Some people don't have a home

But I know there's sunshine behind that rain
I know there's good times behind that pain
Can you tell me how I can make a change

I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray
I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray

I lose my appetite,
Knowing kids starve tonight
Am I a sinner,
'Cause half my dinner is still there on my plate
Ooh I got a vision, to make a difference
And its starting today

'Cause I know there's sunshine behind that rain
I know there's good times behind that pain
Heaven tell me how I can make a change

I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and pray
I close my eyes and I can see a better day
I close my eyes and
Pray for the broken-hearted
I pray for the life not started
I pray for all the lungs not breathing
I pray for all the souls in need
I pray
Can you give 'em one today
I just can't sleep tonight
Can someone tell how to make a change?

I never thought that I could take the burn
I never had the strength to take it higher
Until I reached the point of no return

And there's just no turning back
When your heart's under attack
Gonna give everything I have
It's my destiny

I will never say never! (I will fight)
I will fight till forever! (Make it right)

I will not stay on the ground

And I'm fast enough to run across the sea

I can handle him
Hold up, aight?

Taller than me
And he's older than me
And stronger than me
And his arms a little bit longer than me
But he ain't on a JB song with me!

They be trying to sour the thrill

Like Luke with the force, if push comes to shove
Like Kobe in the 4th, ice water with blood
I gotta be the best, and yes
We're the flyest
Like David and Goliath
I conquered the giant
So now I got the world in my hand
I was born from two stars
So the moon's where I land (I'm gone!)

I will never say never (never say it, never, never say it) I will fight
I will fight till forever (okay, okay) to make it right
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground

Say never (never say it, never say it)

Yo 'Ye whattup

Raekwon
You got stacks like the international house of pancakes
All alone ready to phone me and your hand shakes
Palms is sweat it, don't regret
Never the walk miles for love I sit at starters deck

It just happens I was floating you seen it captain?
Blinked at me then I threw on my thinking cap
Taker, and then we can slide to Jamaica
Shopping for a year or two stop in Diego

It's obvious I'm gon sue your mommy is
We just friends so she can't Clyde Bonnie us
Fly walls down in the fly halls
Come to the master suite leave every piece in the master hall
All about money tied in a know stand over there
That's why I make it happen on blocks
Brazil cut sweater, Audi, leather
Playing the field tryna outslug Berretta

You see my baby over hit the road 
Where she's going I swear nobody knows
I need to find her before another man does
I wouldn't want him to steal my love

I'm just tryin to be cool, cool, cool (tryn'a be cool)
What would you expect me to do (oh oh oh, oh oh oh, yeah)
I'm just tryin to find, find, find
That sweet love of mine

I'm runnin outta time
Where is my runway love
Searching low and high
Know that I'm not givin' up
I give it all up for her
I'll never be enough
I wont stop until I find
My runaway love

Last name West and my teeth Diamonds
She said yo what's your occupation, crazy rhyming?
Listen to Wu Tang
Trying crazy suits on 
Stuntin' in our high top Louie's
Shorts is the coogies
Open up the door when you take her to the movies

When you meet the parents you tell De Niro
Her boyfriend is zero she needs to cut the wierdo
Next show they gotta up the zeroes
Nobody rocking like this sixty years old

The hard johns and the Walleys something caught me
I'm telling you what Wu-Tang taught me
The young youth rocking the gold tooth
Pull up in a drop top old school bumping the cash rules
No question we the reason why the summers blazin'
You looking good fly color Asian
Ra I give it yo ya, no trivia
She used to roll with my G-unit like Olivia
Till she caught me getting numbers not her's
(Sweet runaway love)
Guess that's the day she became a runaway love

I'm runnin outta time
Where is my runaway love
Searching low and high
Know that I'm not givin' up
I give it all up for her
I'll never be enough
I wont stop until I find
My runaway love

Why can't I find, the love of mine, 
When you're standing in front of my face
Oh why (oh why), You must be mine
How did I let you get away

Leave it up to the most high sit in a ghost fly
Chillin' with two of my brothers we both live on deck
Grabbing em on set
This is how we roll independence she a go I'm gon go get
Take that queen assure to ya
We can live every month baby girl just call me up
Waking up mess in some cold sweats thinking of this the video tapes
Even the stress

My mind is a terrible thing to waste
No love lost I know I'm going crazy I can't floss
Me my lady left my homies
It's all baloney just like rocking an old pony
So when I chillin' I'm just lost no more feeling
I need my honey in my life get that film it
Take the time Rae Just and Ye shine
My runaway love give me mine come on

I'm runnin outta time
Where is my runaway love
Searching low and high
Know that I'm not givin' up
I give it all up for her
I'll never be enough
I wont stop until I find

To see if reindeer really know how to fly

At the table with the family,
Having dinner, Blackberry on the hip and then the game a little slicker,
Then it gave a lil' flicker then
I took a look to see, before it activates the ringer
Came to realize the homie Bieber hit me on the Twitter,
Then I hit him back that's right I had some food up on my fingers,
Sipping eggnog, with a little sprinkle of vanilla,
Even though it's kind of cool I'm pulling on a chinchilla,
Bieber hit me back and said lets make it hot up in the winter,
I said cool, cool,
You know I will deliver let's collaborate and make the holiday a little bigger,
Before we work I gotta get this off,
See the other family members and drop gifts off,
Then I'm headed to the studio 'cause ain't nothing stopping,
How you know we about to turn it up and really get it poppin' now,
People everywhere and all our twitter followers,
Merry Christmas, Kwanzaa, happy Hanukkah!

It's crazy how some people say they don't care,
When there's people on the street with no food it's not fair,
It's about time for you to act merrily,
It's about time for you give to charity,
Rarely to people don't wanna even help at all,
'Cause they wont bother buying getting toys getting dolls,
Not thinking there's a family out hungry and cold,
Wishin' wishin' that they had somebody they could hold,
So I think some of you need to act bold,
Can we give to a tribe let's change the globe,

They say that hate has been sent
So let loose the talk of love
Before they outlaw the kiss
Baby give me one last hug

There's a dream
That I've been chasing
Want so badly for it to be reality
(Reality, reality)
And when you hold my hand
Then I understand
That it's meant to be

Cause baby when you're with me
It's like an angel came by, and took me to heaven
(It's like you took me to heaven girl)
Cause when I stare in your eyes
It couldn't be better
(Don't want you to go oh no so)

Let the music blast
We gon' do our dance
Bring the doubters on
They don't matter at all
Cause this life's to long
And this love's to strong
So baby know for sure
That I'll never let you go

I got my favorite girl
Not feelin' no pain or fear
(Pain or fear, pain or fear, no pain)
Oh no, don't have a care in the world
Why would I, when you are here
(You are here, you are here)
There's a moment I've been chasin'
And I finally caught it out on this floor
(On this floor, in this floor)

Baby, there's no hesitation,
No reservation by taking a chance and more
Oh no, because

It's like an angel came by, and took me to heaven
(It's like you took me to heaven girl)
Cause when I stare in your eyes
It couldn't be better
(Don't want you to go, oh no so)

Let the music blast

Cause when I stare in your eyes
It couldn't be better
(Don't want you to go, oh, no, so)

Take my hand, lets just dance
Watch my feet, follow me
Don't be scared, girl I'm here
If you didn't know, this is love

(Let the music blast)

Oh baby

That I'll never let you go
(I'll never let you go)

So don't fear, don't you worry 'bout a thing
I am here (right here)
I'll never let you go, ooh
Don't shed a tear, whenever you need me I'll be near

'Cause we both so distant now
And the walls are closing in on us
And we're wondering how
No one has a solid answer
We're just walking in the dark
And you can see the look on my face
It just tears me apart

So we fight through the hurt
And we cry, and cry, and cry, and cry
Then we live and we learn
And we try, and try, and try, and try

So it's up to you and it's up to me
That we meet in the middle
On our way back down to earth
Down to earth, down to earth
On our way back down to earth
Ooh, oh, oh, ooh

Mama, you were always somewhere
And Daddy I live outta town
So tell me how could I ever be normal some how
You tell me this is for the best
So tell me why am I in tears, whoa
So far away and now I just need you here

So we'll fight through the hurt
And we'll cry, and cry, and cry, and cry
Then we live and we learn
And we try, and try, and try, and try

So it's up to you and it's up to me
That we meet in the middle
On our way back down to earth
Down to earth, down to earth
On our way back down to earth
Ooh, oh, ooh, oh, ooh

We felt so far away from where we used to be
And now we're standing, and where do we go
When there's no road to get to your heart?
Let's start over again

So it's up to you and it's up to me
That we meet in the middle
On our way back down to earth

On our way back down to earth

Remember when my heart was young
You were still bigger than me
Is that the reason that you stayed
Most would've got rid of me
Now the bully's in the school yard
Can't take our hugs and our kisses from us
Because we ain't pushovers no more baby

For this day to come
Now that it's here lets make it special
I can't deny
There's so many thoughts in my mind
The DJ's playing my favorite song ain't no chaperon's this could be
The night of our dreams

Only if you give, give the first dance to me
Girl I promise I'll be gentle, I know we gotta do it slowly
If you give, give your first dance to me
I'm gonna cherish every moment
It only happens once, once in a life time

Under the disco ball, we're the only ones on the floor

The two us remember, no teachers around to see us dancin' close
I'm tellin' you our parents will never know
Before the lights go up and the music turns off
Now's the perfect time for me to taste your lip gloss
Your glass slippers in my hand right here, we'll
Make it before the clock strikes nine

If you just give, give the first dance to me

There's gonna be one less lonely girl(one less lonely girl)
One less lonely girl(one less lonely girl)
There's gonna be one less lonely girl(one less lonely girl)
One less lonely girl

How many I told you's and start overs
And shoulders have you cried on before?
How many promises be honest girl?
How many tears you let hit the floor?

How many bags you packed
Just to take 'em back tell me that
How many either or's (but no more)
If you let me inside of your world
There'd be the one less lonely girl

Saw so many pretty faces (before I saw you you)
Now all I see is you
I'm coming for you (I'm coming for you)
No no
Don't need these other pretty faces like I need you
And when you're mine in the world

There's gonna be one less lonely girl(I'm coming for you)
One less lonely girl (I'm coming for you)
One less lonely girl (I'm coming for you)
One less lonely girl (I'm coming for you)
There's gonna be one less lonely girl (I'm coming for you)
I'm gonna put you first (I'm coming for you)
I'll show you what you're worth (that's what I'm gonna do)
If you let me inside your world
There's gonna be one less lonely girl

Christmas wasn't merry 14th of February
Not one of them spent with you
How many dinner dates set dinner plates and
He didn't even touch his food
How many torn photographs are you taping back
Tell me that couldn't see an open door
But no more
If you let me inside of your world
There'll be one less lonely girl

Saw so many pretty faces
(Before I saw you you)
Now all I see is you
I'm coming for you I'm coming for you
No no
Don't need these other pretty faces like I need you
And when your mine in this world

One less lonely girl
There's gonna be one less lonely girl (I'm coming for you)
I'm gonna put you first (I'm coming for you)
I'll show you what you're worth (that's what I'm gonna do)
If you let me inside of your world
There's gonna be on less lonely girl

I can fix up your broken heart (heart)
I can give you a brand new start (start)
I can make you believe (yeah)
I just wanna set one girl free to fall,
Free to fall (she's free to fall)
Fall in love
With me

Her hearts locked and nowhere to get the key
I'll take her and leave the world with one less lonely girl

There's gonna be one less lonely girl (one less lonely girl)
One less lonely girl (one less lonely girl)
There's gonna be one less lonely girl (one less lonely girl)
One less lonely girl (I'm coming for you)

With you,
I wish we had another time,
I wish we had another place

Now Romeo and Juliet,
Bet they never felt the way we felt,
Bonnie and Clyde,
Never had to hide like,
We do,
We do

You and I both know it can't work,
It's all fun and games,
'Til someone gets hurt,
And I don't,
I won't let that be you

Now you don't wanna let go,
And I don't wanna let you know,
There might be something real between us two, who knew?
Now we don't wanna fall but,
We're tripping in our hearts and it's reckless and clumsy,
Cause I know you can't love me here

I wish we had another time,
I wish we had another place,
But everything we have is stuck in the moment,
And there's nothing my heart can do (can do),
To fight with time and space 'cause,
I'm still stuck in the moment with you

See like Adam and Eve,
Tragedy was our destiny,
Like Sunny and Cher,
I don't care,
I got you baby

See we both,
Fightin' every inch of our fiber,
Cause ain't no way,
It's gonna end right but,
We are both too foolish to stop

Now you don't wanna let go,
And I don't wanna let you know,

And I know you can't love me here

I wish we had another time,
I wish we had another place,
But everything we had is stuck in the moment 'cause,
I'm still stuck in the moment with you

See like,
Just because this cold cold world saying we can't be,
Baby, we both have the right to disagree,
And I ain't with it,
And I don't wanna be so old and gray,
Reminiscin' 'bout these better days,
But convention's telling us to let go,
So we'll never know

I wish we had another time,
I wish we had another place,
Cause everything we did,
And everything we have is stuck in the moment,
Yeah

I never had the strength to take it higher
Until I reach the point of no return

When your heart's under attack
Gonna give everything I have
It's my destiny

I will never say never (I will fight)
I will fight till forever (make it right)

I will not stay on the ground

And I'm fast enough to run across the sea (oh)

When your heart's under attack

Guess who?
J-Smith and J-B!
I gotcha lil' bro
I can handle him
Hold up, aight?
I can handle him

Now he's bigger than me
Taller than me
And he's older than me
And stronger than me
And his arms a little bit longer than me
But he ain't on a J-B song with me

I be trying to chill
They try to sour the thrill
No pun intended, was raised by the power of will
Like Luke with the force, if push comes to shove
Like Kobe in the fourth, ice water with blood (lets go)

I gotta be the best, and yes
We're the fliest
Like David and Goliath,
I conquered the giant
So now I got the world in my hand,
I was born from two stars
So the moon is where I land
(I'm gone)

Quisiera regresar el tiempo y cambiar errores
Sé que todo fue mi culpa y te cuse dolores
Espero que de volver tu tengas intenciones
Porque hoy estoy aquí extrañándote
Okay, tú por mi morías ma
No solo física, había química
Yo te llamaba y no querías contestar
Sé que fui tonto y no te supe valorar
Entiende mi estilo de vida
Por favor comprende que esto no pase de repente
Si está mi mano no te dejo a la suerte

Solo espero que me perdones, nena
Tengo tantas ganas de amarte
Solo quiero que me perdones
Si tú y yo no podemos estar
Olvida todo voy a fallar

'Cause I don't care

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
'Cause I don't care

We at a party we don't wanna be at
Tryna talk, but we can't hear ourselves
Read your lips, I'd rather kiss 'em right back
With all these people all around
I'm crippled with anxiety
But I'm told it's where I'm supposed to be
You know what?
It's kinda crazy 'cause I really don't mind
When you make it better like that

Don't think we fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say, oh yeah, yeah
When we walked in, I said, ""I'm sorry"", mm
But now I think that we should stay

'Cause I don't care
When I'm with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
Yeah, you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (oh yeah, yeah, yeah)
'Cause I don't care
As long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere
And you're making me feel like I'm loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah

/lyric/36879307/Justin+Bieber/Running+Over,Running Over,"From the beginning it was ending
We were emotionally pending
Jeopardy, second guessing
Got all the questions to my answers

Keep running over
Me with your loving
I'm only right here for your consumption
Keep running over
Me with your loving
Looking like it's turning into something

Wednesday
It felt like a Tuesday when you met me
I remember it like it was yesterday
You just said ""Hello"", I lost my sanity
Thought you was looking through me
Then you made me laugh with personality
When you said goodbye that was a tragedy
Had to get a lesson in anatomy
You just ran me over
Look out, watch out, got me on the defense
Thought love at first sight was just a false pretense
Took my hat off, made me pledge allegiance
Everything was in divine sequence

Keep running over
Me with your loving
I'm only right here for your consumption
Keep running over
Me with your loving
Looking like it's turning into something
Better that than turning into nothing (way-oh, way-oh)
Ain't no interrupting this eruption (way-oh, way-oh)

(LD, huh)
I believe in love
Girl, you got my hopes all up
When I left you, when I met you
I called mom and told her 'bout it
I got all up on your IG and was scrolling down for hours
I got back to 2015 and you started looking young, so I stopped (oh)
Post intercourse when you walk by (ass, ass, ass)
More buns than a Shop Rite (whoa)
And you wanna sleep over my crib? 
Lemme go and get you a soft t-shirt, here (soft tee)
What are our kids gonna be like? (Hmm?)
What is your skin routine like?
Girl, just run around bed with me
I'll flirt with you all cleverly (ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
I'll lock you down, Pat Beverley
I'll kiss your breast so tenderly, wussup? (Your breast)
How are you so hot and so cute? (How?)
I wanna make a language up with you
You're already driving me crazy, so just

Keep running over
Me with your loving
I'm only right here for your consumption

Every time I go the wrong way you turn me back around
Turn me back like whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, whoa, forever, ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever?

Yeah, do you see us in Vegas pushing a Monte Carlo?
Bet that money on baby, bet she don't leave me, oh no
See them heat waves in the desert look like a lake in the sand
Would you watch the sun burn out with me forever, ever, ever, ever?
You still intimidate me
Keep me up on my toes now
Better man, what you made me
Made me aware of what I was missing
Been missing the way you give me ambition, babe

Never thought I'd settle down
Reckon I lied to myself
I was busy focusing on being by myself
Set my feelings to the side they all got dusty on a shelf
You wiped them down when I had nothing left

Could you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Waking up all alone ain't better, better, better
Every time I go the wrong way you turn me back around
Turn me back like whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, whoa, forever, ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever?

When you asked me if I cheated, I said never (no way)
What are you willing to do to stay together? (Together)
How many times we gonna break up for the summer?
How many times you gonna try to call my mother?
Girl, you killin' me
I don't wanna act like I can fix this (fix it, fix it)
I don't wanna be the one that's changed since Texas
Currency, it comes so naturally
But I can't buy your love

Could you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Waking up all alone ain't better, better, better
Every time I go the wrong way you turn me back around
Turn me back like whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, whoa, forever, ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever?

I promise I'm gonna love you 'til my dying day
Wake up, your face in my chest
Your favorite hiding place
The roof is gone as we're driving out the private gate
Counting the stars with our last name on the license plate
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
I lied to myself 'bout trying to be here all alone
When I leave, it's bye for now, it's just never bye for long
Set my feelings aside
Let's settle down
Every time I go the wrong way you turn me back around

Turn me back like whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, whoa, forever, ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever?

Won't you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Won't you be here with me forever, ever, ever?

Distance only made us grow fonder
Of one another, be honest
What's your E.T.A.?
What's your E.T.A.?

Before you gotta go (oh-ooh-oh-oh)
Before you gotta go 
Drop a pin for me now
So I can learn your location

Thank you, yes, your less than five minutes away from me
In your arms, rubbing on your face
Only place I wanna be
In the bed, where we lay our head
Only place I wanna be",Justin-Bieber

Open your mind
Don't knock it 'til you try it, darling
Show off

Flowers open when they feel the sunlight
Moon rise, tide change right before our eyes
Aggressive but softly, you place your lips on my lips
We're each others vice

Our feelings go deep, deeper than the touching
Deeper than the ocean, so we ain't never rushing through
Our days, or our nights, ain't no repercussions
Never get enough I'm only for your consumption

Always rain the most in April
Every scale needs to, be stable
Earth keeps spinning around, we're breathing
So thankful

My love for you's habitual, yeah (habitual, yeah)

Make me look even better
When we shine, we shine together

I stay on the defense, to take away your leverage
'Til you put it in perspective

If you don't call me, I'll jump off the roof (hey)

Kiss my sane mind goodbye, I'm bonkers now
Crazy for your love, I do the most
Walking the street up to your mama's house
Dirt road with pink skies and rainbows

Oh, I'll climb the tallest mountain just to hold your hand
And dance around, the thought of you reverbs in my head
And that's what I said

I think I'm falling for you
I think I'm falling for you (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
If you don't call me, I'll jump off the roof
If you don't call me, I'll jump off the roof

Hopefully, I'll find my mind
'Cause I lost it somewhere, along the way
Ooh, and I pray that you find the time
'Cause there's only so many minutes in the day
Yeah, the thought of you fills me with bliss
Looking forward to making memories, we reminisce (hey)
And got a whole lot to risk
Don't send my heart into the abyss

I think I'm falling for you (falling for you)
I think I'm falling for you (falling for you)

Your hips and your eyes give me all the summer vibes
Will you sing your lullaby to me?
We walk through the night and the sun will slowly rise
There's not a place I'd rather be
Then we run up the street
Keep on skipping to the broken beat
Kissing your lips on a trampoline
Girl, I don't know what's gotten into me

I think I'm falling for you (falling for you)
I think I'm falling for you (falling for you)
If you don't call me, I'll jump off the roof (don't let me do it)

Don't think that I'll be a saint

'Cause the way that the sky opens up when we touch
Yeah, it's makin' me say

That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy

I don't do well with the drama
And no, I can't stand it bein' fake
No, no, no, no, no, no-no-no
I don't believe in nirvana
But the way that we love in the night gave me life
Baby, I can't explain

That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy

They say we're too young and
The pimps and the players say, ""Don't go crushin'""
Wise men say, ""Fools rush in""

The first step pleases the Father
Might be the hardest to take
But when you come out of the water
I'm a believer, my heart is fleshy
Life is short with a temper like Joe Pesci
They always come and sing your praises, your name is catchy
But they don't see you how I see you, Parlay and Desi
Cross, Tween, Tween, Hesi' hit the jet speed
When they get messy, go lefty, like Lionel Messi
Let's take a trip and get the Vespas or rent a jet-ski
I know the spots that got the best weed, we goin' next week
I wanna honor, wanna honor you
Bride's groom, I'm my father's child
I know when the son takes the first steps, the Father's proud
If you make it to the water He'll part the clouds
I know He made you a snack like Oscar Proud
Suffer it to be so now gotta clean it up
Formalize the union in communion He can trust
I know I ain't leavin' you like I know He ain't leavin' us
I know we believe in God and I know God believes in us

'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second

Say the word, on my way",Justin-Bieber
/lyric/37668207/Justin+Bieber/Lonely,Lonely,"Everybody knows my name now
But somethin' 'bout it still feels strange
Like lookin' in a mirror, tryna steady yourself
And seein' somebody else
And everything is not the same now
It feels like all our lives have changed
Maybe when I'm older, it'll all calm down
But it's killin' me now

What if you had it all
But nobody to call?
Maybe then, you'd know me
'Cause I've had everything
But no one's listening
And that's just fuckin' lonely

I'm so lonely
Lonely

Everybody knows my past now
Like my house was always made of glass
And maybe that's the price you pay
For the money and fame at an early age
And everybody saw me sick
And it felt like no one gave a shit
They criticized the things I did
As an idiot kid

What if you had it all
But nobody to call?
Maybe then, you'd know me
'Cause I've had everything
But no one's listening
And that's just fuckin' lonely

I'm so lonely
Lonely
I'm so lonely
Lonely",Justin-Bieber
